## Moving To The Product Operating Model

#### by Marty Cagan

### Chapter 1 - Who Is This Book For?

- This book is for anyone that is part of a company that is already, or planning, to operate with a product operating model.
- It's not important WHAT you sell, but how you design and build it as well as operate your business.
- The product operating model is for anyone that believes they should be powering their business with technology.
- If you haven't read INSPIRED or EMPOWERED this book provides the necessary foundation to make it useful to you still.

### Chapter 2 - What Is a Product Operating Model?

- The Product Operating Model (a.k.a product model) is about consistently creating technology-opowered solutions that your customers love and work for your business.
- The terms product-led or product-centric are often used interchangeably for product model but have the unfortunate side effect of implying that product is running the show.
- When determining what model a non-product company is using it's best to think who's in the driving seat? (i.e. IT, marketing, sales, etc.)
- Products are any technology-based systems, services, devices, tools, etc. that are created and managed by an organization, whether internal or external in focus.s

### Chapter 3 - Why Transform?

- There are typically 3 major drivers for companies that are looking to make a transformation: 
    - Competitive threats from the core market they support
    - Compelling prizes from successfully completing a product model transformation
    - Leaders that are frustrated with how slowly they're achieving and innovating
- Additional factors that can add pressure from a leadership perspective
    - Your start technology personnel are leaving out of frustration
    - There's new leadership that come from a product model background and are evangelising it
    - Loyal customers are expressing frustration with the lack of adaptation and improvement

### Chapter 4 - A Typical Transformation

- Many companies have attempted transformation before and have failed for various reasons but the story feels similar to an extent for all of them.
- The company finds initial success by specializing in delivery customized solutions based on what salespeople can sell.
- At a certain point you hit a critical mass of customized solutions and it's no longer tenable to maintain so many separate things and delivering new things slows to a crawl.
- New executives are hired with the promise of transforming the company by re-organizing and re-focusing the business vision.
- A whole new set of challenges arise as engineers are hired with competitive salaries and the product team is built out exceeding budgetary constraints.
- Year(s) into the transformation there's still slow moving progress and engineering is encouraged to refactor where they can and focus on delivering road map wins.
- More process is introduced with a focus on increasing predictable releases on a less frequent basis.
- A key number of the engineers that were hired on to make the transformation successful resign citing a lack of progress.
- A small remaining number of engineering and product leaders approach the CEO to try to address the technology needs that have been born out of technology mismanagement.
- The CEO has lost the support of the board and the transformation has failed.

### Chapter 5 - The Role of the CEO

- The CEO doesn't need to be experienced in the product model or spend a lot of time in the transformation itself, however it plays a critical role in the transformation.
- Transformation impacts every aspect of the business, not just engineering and product, and the stakeholders will ultimately look to the CEO for what's important.
- "The company cares about what the leader cares about." - Bill Campbell
- CEO's can't just delegate the transformation to a CIO or CTO because they aren't responsible for the entire organization.
- Transformation does require certain capabilities to be estiblished within product, design, and engineering but, the entire organization is needed for transformation.
- The CEO needs to be viewed as the chief evangelist of the product model, if they're not on board then your transformation readiness may need reassessed.
