# Transformed

## Moving To The Product Operating Model

#### by Marty Cagan

### Chapter 1 - Who Is This Book For?

- This book is for anyone that is part of a company that is already, or planning, to operate with a product operating model.
- It's not important WHAT you sell, but how you design and build it as well as operate your business.
- The product operating model is for anyone that believes they should be powering their business with technology.
- If you haven't read INSPIRED or EMPOWERED this book provides the necessary foundation to make it useful to you still.

### Chapter 2 - What Is a Product Operating Model?

- The Product Operating Model (a.k.a product model) is about consistently creating technology-opowered solutions that your customers love and work for your business.
- The terms product-led or product-centric are often used interchangeably for product model but have the unfortunate side effect of implying that product is running the show.
- When determining what model a non-product company is using it's best to think who's in the driving seat? (i.e. IT, marketing, sales, etc.)
- Products are any technology-based systems, services, devices, tools, etc. that are created and managed by an organization, whether internal or external in focus.s

### Chapter 3 - Why Transform?

- There are typically 3 major drivers for companies that are looking to make a transformation: 
    - Competitive threats from the core market they support
    - Compelling prizes from successfully completing a product model transformation
    - Leaders that are frustrated with how slowly they're achieving and innovating
- Additional factors that can add pressure from a leadership perspective
    - Your start technology personnel are leaving out of frustration
    - There's new leadership that come from a product model background and are evangelising it
    - Loyal customers are expressing frustration with the lack of adaptation and improvement

### Chapter 4 - A Typical Transformation

- Many companies have attempted transformation before and have failed for various reasons but the story feels similar to an extent for all of them.
- The company finds initial success by specializing in delivery customized solutions based on what salespeople can sell.
- At a certain point you hit a critical mass of customized solutions and it's no longer tenable to maintain so many separate things and delivering new things slows to a crawl.
- New executives are hired with the promise of transforming the company by re-organizing and re-focusing the business vision.
- A whole new set of challenges arise as engineers are hired with competitive salaries and the product team is built out exceeding budgetary constraints.
- Year(s) into the transformation there's still slow moving progress and engineering is encouraged to refactor where they can and focus on delivering road map wins.
- More process is introduced with a focus on increasing predictable releases on a less frequent basis.
- A key number of the engineers that were hired on to make the transformation successful resign citing a lack of progress.
- A small remaining number of engineering and product leaders approach the CEO to try to address the technology needs that have been born out of technology mismanagement.
- The CEO has lost the support of the board and the transformation has failed.

### Chapter 5 - The Role of the CEO

- The CEO doesn't need to be experienced in the product model or spend a lot of time in the transformation itself, however it plays a critical role in the transformation.
- Transformation impacts every aspect of the business, not just engineering and product, and the stakeholders will ultimately look to the CEO for what's important.
- "The company cares about what the leader cares about." - Bill Campbell
- CEO's can't just delegate the transformation to a CIO or CTO because they aren't responsible for the entire organization.
- Transformation does require certain capabilities to be estiblished within product, design, and engineering but, the entire organization is needed for transformation.
- The CEO needs to be viewed as the chief evangelist of the product model, if they're not on board then your transformation readiness may need reassessed.

### Chapter 6 - A Guide to TRANSFORMED

- Each part in the book addresses a key portion of the learning process and uses success stories to illustrate what success looks like.
- Successful transformation is indeed hard to pull off and requires tackling tough issues even when those involved don't want to hear it.
- Product leaders have as much work to do to make a transformation at their company successful as the executives do.
- PRoduct leaders must taking responsibility for raising the skill levels of the product people.
- You have as much ownership as you have credibility and part of your job as a product leader is to change hearts and minds.

## Part II - Transformation Defined

Throughout the book we look at product model change along 3 different dimensions:
1. Changing how you build
2. Changing how you solve problems
3. Changing how you decide which problems to solve

#### Changing How You Build

The rise of so-caled fake agile lets companies trick themselves into thinking they are working the way they need to without actually improving how the build things in any real way.  We need to be instrumenting our technology, monitoring our platforms, and prove value before delivering capabilities more broadly.  If not using continuous delivery 2 week releases is the bare minimum.

#### Changing How You Solve Problems

Instead of perceived solutions being passed down to feature teams via a road map the product team is assigned problems to solve.  The team is empowered to discover a solution that is valuable, usable, feasible, and viable.  Decisions get pushed down tot he people closes to the technology to be enabled to solve the problems by rapidly testing ideas on the path to discovering a solution worth building.

#### Changing How You Decide Which Problems To Solve

A strong product company has a compelling product vision and an insight-based product strategy to identify the most critical problems that need to be solved to delivery on business objectives.  This requires strong product leaders that receive necessary coaching and strategic context.

### Chapter 7 - Changing How You Build

- Everything we build has two valuable outputs, what we create and what we learn.  In the project model we often lose most of what we learn.
- Teams that have to live with code they write will treat it differently than engineers that know they're rolling off lately.
- Product model operation requires releasing often, sometimes many times a day, and with instrumentation to make sure everything is operating as expected.
- Many companies have adopted agile methodologies in an effort to force smaller and more frequent releases, but agile is not required to accomplish this necessarily through CI/CD pipelines.
- If you're following agile processes but you're only releasing ever month/quarter/year you're still not agile and certainly not transformed.

### Chapter 8 - Changing How You Solve Problems

- Most industry analysts say that features and projects on roadmaps that generate a positive return on investment is only 10 to 30 percent.
- Feature teams are set up to serve the stakeholders in your business instead of your customers in ways that work for your business.
- In feature teams the project work that you take on is typically from business leaders or other stakeholders and if that project does not generate value it's not the engineering team's fault, it's the fault of the stakeholder that requested it.
- You can work backwards from feature asks to determine what underlying problems they're trying to solve, then figure out how it's going to be measured and what the desired outcome will be.
- Empowered teams not only improve morale, but empowered engineers are essential to innovation.
- Evidence of whether or not you have shifted how you view engineers philosophically is how many of them are outsourced versus other roles. 
- Time to market is important for product teams but time to money is more imporant (i.e. how long does it take to get an idea through product discovery and has the necessary impact).
- Prototypes to test ideas in product discovery should be at least one order of magnitude less expensive than using engineers to build, test, and deploy.
- It is much more difficult to take responsibility for solving problems than to just build what features/projects are put in front of you.
- Outcome-based roadmaps can be useful in forcing you to think about solving problems isntead of delivering features.  To do this you look at the outputs on a roadmap, figure out what problem each thing is hoping to solve and what the measure of success is.  This shifts you from features and dates focused roadmap discussions and to problems you need to solve and the outcomes you need to meet to solve them.

### Chapter 9 - Changing How You Decide Which Problems To Solve

- Moving from feature roadmaps to outcome roadmaps is a step in the right direction, but are they the most important probles to be solved for our company and our customers?
- Changing how you decide which problems to solve is the third dimension of movign to the product model.
- Product vision is describing the future you're trying to create.
- "The main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing." - Jim Barksdale, CEO
- "If you chase two rabbits, you will not catch either one." - Russian proverb
- Good product strategy is a force multiplier, and in a company with good go-to-market strategy and/or business strategy but not product strategy you cannot operate in the product model properly.
- There is not one right way to build products, the product model is a conceptual model and not a prescription or process with steps that guarantee success.

## Part III - Product Model Components

- Product teams exist to solve hard problems for your customers and for your business, in ways your customer love, yet work for the business.
- A challenge that can be a pitfall is implementing the new titles for a product model without learnign the core competencies that come with it.

#### Product Managers, Product Designers, and Engineers

To discover effective solutions for you product the team must address four different risks:
1. Value risk - Will the customer buy or solution or choose to use it?
2. Viability risk - Will this solution work for our business?  Is it something we can effectively and legally market, sell, service, fund, and monetize?
3. Usability risk - Can users easily learn, use, and perceive the value of the solution?
4. Feasability risk - Do we know how to build and scale this solution with the staff, time, technology, and data we have?

- Product Manager - responsible for the value and viability risks and achieving the targeted product outcomes.
- Product Designer - responsible for the usability risk and product experience.
- Tech Lead - responsible for the feasibility risk and product delivery.

#### Product Leaders

- These are the managers of product management, product design, and engineering.
- They are responsible for ensuring that the product organization is aligned witht he larger company in pursuing the best opportunities and addressing the most serious threats.
- If you don't have these people in place you should first hire them before starting your transformation.

### Chapter 10 - Product Mangers

- This is the most difficult competency to establish in a company trying to transform.
- One of the reasons this role is so messy is because it likely exists in a non-product model organization with different competencies and responsibiliities.
- A deep understanding of the users and customers is necessary to asses "value" and a solid understanding of the business is necessary to asses "viability".
- A clear sign that the product team doesn't have a competent product manager is the need to escalate decisions to a manager or a group of stakeholders.

Here are 2 candid realities to set the expectation for the level of skill a product manager should have:
1. Your head of product will be judged by his/her weakest product manager.
2. Your CEO should believe that each of your product managers has the potential to be a future leader of your company in the next five or so years.

- The product model collapses when you do not hold your product managers to a high enough bar, the team is missing needed cross-functional skills, the stakeholders don't trust the team, and the product teams can't deliver desired outcomes.
- In order to be successful, a product manager needs unencumbered access to three consituencies; users and customer, product data, and business stakeholders
- Produc thought leader Shreyas Doshi refers to true domain expertise as domain knowledge minus domain dogma.

### Chapter 11 - Product Designers

> "Design is not just what it looks like and feels like.  Design is how it works." -Steve Jobs

- Out of all of the design skills (service/interaction/visual/industrial), the most important for a product designer is proven interaction design knowledge and skills.
- Product designers are not just there to "make things pretty", they are there to help discover an effective solution!
- Not only do designers create experiences, but they intentionally design changes to those experiences.
- The skill level required for a good product designer in the product model should be on par with a product manager or engineer and compensated as such.

### Chapter 12 - Tech Leads

- The tech lead is an individual contributor, not an engineering manager.
- There are 2 dimensions that engineers are different in the product model versus others.
    1. Tech leads are much more involved in managing technical debt, performance, fault tolerance, scalability, etc.  Product engineers are not invested in these typically.
    2. Tech leads are invested in determining and building the right solution for the problem, not just implementing solutions that the product manager gives them.
- Engineers have to care just as much about what they build as how they build it.

> "If the tech lead is unable or unwilling to engage in product discovery, then you are very likely guaranteeing that the eventual product will not achieve your goals."

### Chapter 13 - Product Leaders

> "What gets in the way of good work?  There are only two possibilities.  The first is that people don't know how to do good work.  The second is that they know, but they aren't motivated." - Andy Grove, legendary CEO

#### Coaching
- It is the single most important responsibility of every people manager to develop the skill of their people.
- People within the organization should report to someone that is an expert in their craft, engineers to engineers, designers to designers, etc.
- How much time you spend coachign your people varies by the number and experience of their reports, but it's normal for first-level managers to spend 80% of their week on staffing and coaching.

#### Staffing
- Staffing includes sourcing, recruiting, interviewing, onboarding, evaluating, promoting, and replacing (when needed) members of the team.
- Doing this well take a lot of time and effort, can be difficult, and is likely not the type of product work you prefer to do.

> "Setting the bar high in our approach to hiring has been and will be the single most important element of Amazon's success." Jeff Bezos

#### Leadership
- You can leader a product organization by either command and control or by empowering the teams.
- Command and control means you are explicitly telling your team what to do, usual through a roadmap of projects and features.
- Empowering teams means you assign them business or customer problems to solve and let them determine how they're going to solve them.
- Pushing decisions down to the product team requires providing context, particularly on the product vision and strategy, to ensure they have the needed info to make good decisions.
- Product leaders are responsible for product vision, team topology, product strategy, and team objectives.

#### Product Vision
- The product vision describes the future you are tryuing to create as well as, most importantly, how the vision improves the lives of your customers.
- This is a shared goal of the product organization and usually has a time line that stretches forward between 3 and 10 years.
- The product vision is more art than science and is meant to persuade and inspire.

#### Team Topology
- This is how you define the responsibilities and ownership of the different product teams within the organization.
- Teams often have a topology that was unintentional and a reflection of the organization via Conway's Law (an anti-parttern for product operating model)
- Creating an effective team topology is crucial to success, but can be difficult and requires collaboration and negotiation with the heads of product, design, and engineering.

#### Product Strategy
- Product strategy describes how you plan to accomplish the product vision and meet the needs of the business along the way.
- This helps to get the most out of whatever product teams you have.
- The output of the product strategy is what business/customer problems you will solve.

#### Team Objectives
- Each team must have one or two clear objectives that are clear and can be executed (typically within a quarter)
- These objectives typically come directly from the product strategy and are a manifestation of the insights being turned to actions.
- The litmus test of empowered teams is if they are able to decide how to solve the problem objectives they have been assigned.

#### Ongoign Evngelism
- Communicating all of the things in this chapter across the organization.
- Doing this consistently requires constant communication in recruiting, onboarding, 1 on 1s, coaching, and company wide meetings.
- In each example studied in TRANSFORMED the CEO made sure to have strong leaders of product management, design, and engineering.

### Chapter 14 - Innovation Story: Almosafer

- Almosafe is a travel and tourism company based in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
- They started their transition to product model in 2018 to provide better regional service in their industry than the global services.
- This allowed them to build skills in continuously interviewing customers to identify unmet needs, collect and analyze data, and prototype and test ideas based on their findings.
- During COVID travel was crippled but in the need to gather in outdoor spaces with more room to spread out they found a niche in helping solve a new problem which was helping customers find and book istirahas (technically translates to resting place but is typically a large outdoor courtyard or other outdoor area).

## Part IV - Product Model Concepts

- These are product model concepts that you need to get right, one way or another, otherwise your transformation will likely collapse.

#### Product Model First Principles
These principles are the common beliefs of all product companies that operate well with this model, regardless if if they started that way or transformed to product model at some point.  Understanding these principles will also help evaluate processes, techniques, roles, and team members to know if they will be helpful or harmful in this product operating model.

#### Product Model Concepts
- Product Team - The foundation of the product operating model, these teams must be cross-functional.
- Product Strategy - Driven by insights that come from a strong and inspiring product vision.
- Product Discovery - This is how the product teams discover which solutions are worth building.
- Product Delivery - How product teams consistently, quickly, and reliably build solutions.
- Product Culture - Making sure the teams are experimenting and innovating to find solutions that work for the business and customers.

### Chapter 15 - Product Teams

- Empowered, cross-functional product teams are fundamental to the product operating model and it's where effective product innovation comes from.

#### Principle: Empowered with Problems to Solve

> "An empowered product team exists to solve problems in ways that your customers love, yet work for your business."

- A team is empowered when they are assigned a problem to solve, not a list of projects and features to build.
- Beign cross-functional means team members on the team can cover each of the product competencies necessary to come up with solutions.
- The product triad or troika is the product manager, product designer, and tech lead.

#### Principle: Outcomes over Output

> "At the end of the day, you know that unless the customer believes your new solution solves their problem sufficiently better than what they've been using, you fail."

- These teams are created to efficiently solve problems, not ship features that will never be used.
- At times, teams looking at data find that the best way to improve outcomes might be to actually remove functionality.

#### Principle: Sense of Ownership

> "If you want the product team to truly feel empowered and accountable, then you need them to feel a real sense of ownership over what they're responsible for."

- Each team needs to be responsible for something meaningful, whether it's a stand alone product or a subset of a much larger product.
- Teams need to be responsible for coming up with solutions for assigned problems and delivery of those solutions.

#### Principle: Collaboration

- Collaboration does not mean; product manager defines requirements, designer creates a design that meets those requirements, engineers build that design/feature as part of a sprint.
- Collaboration does not mean consensus or democracy, which is why it's important to practice "disagree and commit".
- Typically you defer the decision to the topic expert but in the case of a strong disagreement it's best to run a test.
- Collaboration is not about product managers creating artifacts, often times this is referred to as a requirement which ends the conversation and moves the discussion to implementation.
- Collaboration is not about compromise, a mediocre user experience, slow performance, and limited scalability you lose as a team.
- True collaboration is everyone bringing their skillset to the table to solve problems together and challenge each other's ideas.
- Designers have a deep understandign of the users and their behaviors.
- Engineers have deep insights into the enabling technology.
- Product managers have a deep understanding of the customers and the business.
- Collaboration means all product roles working together to come up with a solution that solves for all constraints.

### Chapter 16 - Product Strategy

> "If product teams are all about solving hard problems, then product strategy is all about how you decide which problems are most important to solve."

#### Principle: Focus

> "People think focus means saying yes to the thing you've got to focus on.  But that's not what it means at all.  It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are.  You have to pick carefully.  I'm actually as proud of the things we haven't done as the things I have done.  Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things." - Steve Jobs

- It's important for the product leaders to be transparent and not be perceived as having an agenda.
- Often, it's best for the CEO to select 2 or 3 of the most important goals to pursue, then the product leaders can focus on executing on those objectives.

#### Principle: Powered by Insights

> "Insights provide the leverage points that show you how to concentrate your efforts."

Primary source for insights:
1. Analyzing the data - How are your customers buying or using your products and is it changing over time?
2. Talking to your customers - What do they use today, what context can they share, what would it take for them to switch?
3. New enabling technologies - What can engineers solve today that they couldn't before?
4. The broader industry - What are competitors doing, what are trends, how are expectations changing?

- Product leaders should agreggate these insights and analyze them to help the product team come up with solutions.

#### Principle: Transparency

- Product leaders must be open and honest about sharing the reasoning and data behind the product strategy decisions they're making so the stakeholders aren't led to believe that they're pursuing their own agenda.
- Often times product leaders will need buy-in from different stakeholders in the organization.
- The benefit of this transparency is that the rationale for the product strategy is clear and the organization is aligned.

#### Principle: Placing Bets

- Even with the best product teams and leaders not every product will solve every problem every quarter like clockwork.
- Problems come in a variety of shapes and sizes and are being solved by teams with different levels of skill.
- If you have a critical problem to solve you can assign multiple product teams to solving it with the hopes that even one will yield significant progress on the business objectives.

### Chapter 17: Product Discovery

> "Product teams are responsible for both figuring out the best solution to the problems they've been asked to solve (product discovery), and then building and delivering those solutions (product delivery)."

#### Principle: Minimize Waste

> "The first principle in product discovery is to try to solve the problem with a minimum amount of wasted time and effort."

- The majority of solutions built (generally 70 to 90 percent) end up not delivering the necessary business results.
- Failure to deliver results is not only costly from an engineering hours spent perspective but also from an opportunity cost perspective.
- The key behind product discovery is testing out ideas quickly and finding solutions worthy building so you can get that solution to market.

#### Principle: Asset Product Risks

There are 4 primary risks in building products:
- Value Risk: Does it provide the necessary value to customers for them to choose it?
- Usability Risk: Can users figure out how to use it or is it too confusing?
- Viability Risk: Are there things preventing us from building it such as legal, cost, lack of market, etc.?
- Feasibility Risk: Can we actually build this product or will it take too long or are there other limiting factors?

> "Some problems you're working on have very minor risks, and others have several very major risks.  But every effort has risks that you need to consider."

- Assess the risks before you decide to build anything.

#### Principle: Embrace Rapid Experimentation

- Experimentation is necessary to know if customers would be able to learn and use something.
- A culture that embraces experimentation helps address risk and is central to innovation.
- Disagreements are common, and even a good sign, in the product model and experimentation helps resolve those disagreements with data instead of argumentation.
- Having team mates with skills in analyzing both qualitative and quantitative data will help validate the outcomes of these experiments.
- Building products with instrumentation is key to creating the datasets that allow this analysis to better inform decisions, without it we're flying blind.

#### Principle: Test Ideas Responsibly

- Small companies may be able to move quicker than larger companies but might lack the amount of traffick to generate meaningful results from an experiment.
- Larger companies may have more traffic, but if they are not correctly instrumenting their applications they will lack the data needed to inform decisions which is a necessary change.
- Larger companies also have a lot more to lose and should assess the risks, run experiments, collect data, and iterate quickly while making sure to protect things like: company revenue, reputation, customers, and your colleagues.

### Chapter 18: Product Delivery

> Reliability is our most important feature.

#### Principle: Small, Frequent, Uncoupled Releases

- At a minimum product teams should be releasing every other week, strong product teams release multiple times a day.
- The two main aspects you must test for releases are new feature functionality and regression.
- "Big Bang" releases are prone to delays because of the nature of integrating and testing hundreds or thousands of changes and the problems then cause when pulled together and are often plagued by defects after the fact.

> High Integrity Commitments - When you need to deliver a specific thing on a specific date, usually due to some sort of outside constraint like a partner relationship or a marketing campaign.  These date should not be set by anyone other than the people responsible for doing the work and often times it's best to create a feasibility prototype before committing.

#### Principle: Instrumentation

- Instrumentation is key at every level to understand the health and usage patterns of your system, otherwise you're flying blind.
- Good analytics and instrumentation can help you solve issues or spot user struggles without needing someone to report them.
- Understanding how your products are used and what improvements you need to drive is something that's never done and is always improving.

#### Principle: Monitoring

- Monitoring, also known as observability, happens at all levels and helps ensure your application is behaving correctly.
- This helps you surface system errors or issues often before customers really notice them.
- It's important to note that with both instrumentation and monitoring you need to be sure that no sensitive data is being logged.

#### Principle: Deployment Infrastructure

- Using infrastructure to A/B test new functionality is considered the "gold standard" for validating if a new feature has the desired effect or not, but depends on significant levels of traffic to be effective.
- Product teams that are doing this often run hundreds of tests simultaneously.
- It is not uncommon, given each companies unique and special needs, to have a combination of commercial and customer infrastructure to support their specific use cases.

> Technical Deb - Usually the result of acquisitions where you inherit the technical debt of an existing application or the fallout from older style project based funding for projects that don't think holistically about long term support or improvements.  The symptoms are work that should take days will take weeks or months.  The product model allows the teams to focus on improving this over time.  To get a good handle on tech deb you need to work on it daily, with about 10 to 30 percent of your engineering capacity.

### Chapter 19: Product Culture

#### Principle: Principles over Process

> "Good process serves you so you can serve customers.  But if you're not watchful, the process can become the thing.  This can happen very easily in large organizations....The process is not the thing.  It's always worth asking, do we own the process or does the process own us?" - Jeff Bezos

> "That's what makes great products.  It's not process; it's content...The system is that there is no system.  That doesn't mean we don't have process...But that's not what it's about." - Steve Jobs

> "The reason Netflix has been so successful is because it has a culture that values people over process.  Emphasizes innovation over efficiency, and has very few controls." - Reed Hastings

> "Process is great when you live in a world where both the problem and solution are known.  Process helps ensure that you can deliver solutions that scale without breaking other parts of the organization...These processes reduce risk to an overall organization, but each layer of process reduces the ability to be agile and lean and-most important-be responsive to new opportunities and threats." - Steve Blank

- Process is not inherently bad, however if you're not careful, managers coming in from companies with their own processes and culture can inadvertently create barriers for a company trying to optimize for innovation.
- When trying to correct from a mistake, it's more empowering to provide coaching instead of imposing new process to prevent he mistake in the future.
- Don't become religious about process, always practice continuous process improvement.

#### Principle: Trust over Control

- Empowering product teams and providing a list of problems to solve is at the heart of moving from command-and-control to the product operating model and requires trust.
- Moving from micromanagement to servant-based leadership with a focus on active coaching is required.
- Leading with context rather than control is key to being successful.

#### Principle: Innovation over Predictability

> "100% predictability = 0% innovation." - Henrik Kniberg

- Companies that focus on predictability, or the number of features they ship often lack innovation as a result.
- Predictability focused companies say that it's the stakeholder's job to make sure valuable features are shipped.
- Predictability is good, but not as important or necessary as innovation.
- The best way to handle occasional predictability needs is with high-integrity commitments.
- Ironically, product teams usually have a faster time-to-money than time-to-market because they already have context, relationships, and platform knowledge that lets them engage much faster than project teams.
- Is a date the priority or is the outcome?  Hitting a date can be a priority but it should be the exception not the rule.

#### Principle: Learning over Failure

- A deeply rooted fear of failure drives people and process to avoid risk.
- We should not glamorize failure but everything should be looked at as an opportunity to learn.
- Experiments never fail, they only provide information with which a product team can learn.

### Chapter 20: Innovation Story: Carmax

- Company background - The company realized it needed to disrupt itself to stay relevant, especially in the technology space.  The company's consumer facing digital experience was the focus of the Carmax transformation at the hand of Ann Yauger.  This proved to be very successful and generated a lot of powerful innovations in the used car buying experience that made the company a leader in the used car buying and selling space.

- The problem to solve - The restrictions imposed by the pandemic meant that selling in person was not only much more challenging from a regulatory standpoint, but customers were tending not to shop in person anymore.  Carmax had already been exploring an omnichannel sales path which would allow purchasing a car on the web or mobile app possible.  The pandemic made this mission critical for the companies survival.

- Discovering the solution - They needed to not only provide a way for customers to interact with sales associates virtually, but also had to handle the logistics of purchasing a car which includes getting approved for financing, digitally signing contracts, arranging work orders, delivery or pickup scheduling, etc.  In addition to this they had to build out all of the tooling to allow trade-ins and provide a way to get an accurate state of the trade-in car without ever seeing it in person.  

- The results - They not only recovered the lost revenue from the beginning of the pandemic and more, but they also set themselves apart as one of the only automotive sellers that could provide a reliable car buying and selling processing completely online.  Additionally, Carmax hs earned a reputation as one of the best places to work for product and technology talent.

## Part V - Transformation Story: Trainline

- KKR, a private equity company, purchased Trainline because it believed it was undervalued.
- They hired a successful technology leader, Clare Gilmartin, in as a new CEO who brought along Mark Holt as the experienced CTO and Jon Moore as the company's first Chief Product Officer.
- The had to replace outsourced engineers with FTE's, migrate their infrastructure from on-premises to the cloud, address mountains of technical debt, and speed up their release cadence from the 8 weeks they started at.
- They created a weekly Friday afternoon meeting called "Weekly Wins" to discuss and debate progress.
- They decided to focus on two critical core problems: mobile app usage and site conversion.
- They built a highly skilled mobile team that set a quick pace and with strong recruiting and coaching were able to achieve significant business outcomes which were quickly and often celebrated by leadership.  Other teams soon followed the example set by the mobile team.
- A data science team was created to organize their data and mine key insights from it to further improve user experiences.
- Hack Days were implemented and a single engineer decided to solve the long standing customer problem of finding less crowded train cars which turned out to be wildly successful.
- By bringing on a team to interview different cohorts of customers they were able to find seven major cross cutting problems that they needed to solve which they termed the "Super Seven".  This concerns were soon validated by the data they had from their users and they had new focused problems to work.
- Only 2 years after being acquired by KKR for 500M pounds, the company was valued at just over 2B pounds.

## Part VI - The Product Model in Action

This section talks about how product teams interacts with customers and other internal groups in an idealized sense.  It's important to consider that even in a great company with the best people things won't always go as you would like.

### Chapter 21: Partnering with Customers

- The product model relies on direct and frequent interaction between the product team and actual users.
- If customers are dependent on your product they might hold on for as long as they can before jumping ship.
- Customers can be receptive to changing the nature of the relationship if they think it means their needs will be met more frequently and not less.

#### Promises

Only the product team should make promises for deliverables and only when they know exactly what is required to deliver on that promise.  Not the executive team, sales, marketing, or anyone else.  This is known as a high-integrity commitment.

### Chapter 22: Partnering with Sales

- The most interdependent roles in a company exists between product and sales in most cases, assuming a sales team that is responsible to bring products to market exists in the organization.
- Despite this natural interdependence, in non-product model companies they are often at odds with one another.
- Salespeople collecting requirements from customers and delivering those requirements to the product teams is not part of the product model.
- In order for product and sales teams to work well together it starts by developing trust through interacting with one another in front of existing and prospective customers.  Through these interactions product is able to see how sales navigates aspects of effective go-to-market and sales gets an understanding of how product can help find solutions that customers may not have thought of that solves their problems better than they anticipated.
- Ultimately, the goal of this partnership is happy and referenceable customers.

### Chapter 23: Partnering with Product Marketing

- One of the closest partners for product teams is the product marketing manager (PMM) associated with the team.
- The PMM is a key resource for product teams to understand markets and will often have access to industry analysts, market insights, competitive research, and more.
- Perhaps the most important area of collaboration between the product team and their PMM is the go-to-market strategy and the PMM is there to help the team effectively get the product into the hands of customers.
- Product teams will want to include their PMM in key product decisions to make sure they have an approach that aligns with their go-to-market strategy.
- A customer discovery program is a collaboration between the product manager and PMM to work with prospective customers in the market and build a product that meets all of their needs.
- The PMM should be aware of all new changes coming to the application so they can assess impact to customers, sales, and customer success teams.
- The PMM should be responsible for pricing and packaging, partly because of their expertise, and access to specialty pricing firms, and partly because it's usually done at a higher granularity than the product team. 

### Chapter 24: Partnering with Finance

- The company depends on the product it sells, and product depends on finance.
- Alignment is important, understanding the needs and constraints of the partner based on data rather than opinions.
- Getting finance on board with the product model means explaining how the previous model has not been very predictive and can be illustrated by leaning on actual results from previous quarters.
- Sometimes testing the product model with a team or small group of teams to demonstrate the value is the best way to prove it's usefulness.
- Product and finance collaboration
    1. Product teams stop hiding behind features and roadmaps
    2. Product will be measured by business results
    3. Signing up to solve a problem means determining what success looks like with business results
    4. The team will admit what they don't know and run necessary testing to get data for informed business decisions
    5. Requests will be presented with data and transparent analysis reasoning for that request
    6. Instead of large funding request they will run low cost tests to gather data
    7. When they company needs a date they will take the extra time to understand the problem and provide a high-integrity-commitment
    8. The product team will provide evidence that these investments are paying off when they have the data

- What product needs from finance
    1. Rather than funding decisions being based on projects it should staff product teams with business results for one or more quarters and then be measured on business results.
    2. New competencies will be developed whether that means coaching and training or hiring in new staff to replace existing.
    3. Rather than judge the product team on shipping features it should be judged on business impact, which means giving the team room to test what features should be built and then measure the impact of those features.
    4. Limit the amount of requested high-integrity-commitments because they are expensive to provide and disruptive to the organization.

### Chapter 25: Partnering with Stakeholders

- A stakeholder is not a member of the product team but represents a key constituency, business area, or expertise.
- Although under the product model the team is no longer subservient to the stakeholders the trust between stakeholders and the product team is still highly important.
- Creating products the customers love is not difficult, assuming you have access to customers and data, but doing so also meeting the needs of the business can be difficult.
- A key to building trust with the stakeholders is making sure that a competent product manager is on each product team and can represent the various constraints of the business.
- Working with stakeholders means giving them access to prototypes so they can make sure business constraints are met, allowing them to participate in testing with customers and users, and giving them access to data on the product.

### Chapter 26: Partnering with Executives

- Much of the product model transformation is focused on the product and technology teams, but it is also important to recognize the shift in how executives interact with these teams.
- The biggest shifts needed are to provide the product teams with a deep understanding of the executive team's strategic context, and to provide the executive team with the information they need to run the business.
- Here are a set of techniques to encourage effective interactions between the executives and the product leaders/teams:
    1. Decisions should be made by the product leaders/teams and executives need to provide enough strategic context to them so they are empowered to make these decisions.
    2. Product teams should not be measured on output, but rather on outcomes for the business problems they are assigned to solve by the executive team.
    3. When disagreements arise, the product team is responsible for running experiments and collecting the necessary evidence, or where necessary, proof, in order to back up decisions.
    4. Promises are the exception not the rules for product teams.  When they have to commit to a date, the product team will learn and understand what's involved and commit to a date that they can deliver by and meet that commitment.
    5. Surprises should be avoided, whether that's the product team not informing executives of a decision or not giving them  access to review a prototype.  Likewise, if an executive reviews something and raises no issues until it's in production that is also a surprise that should be avoided.
    6. Product teams and leaders must understand that they are empowered and operate with a degree of trust and they must strive to earn that trust.  They must also trust that the executives are leading the company in a positive direction.

### Chapter 27: Innovation Story: Gympass

- The company started in Brazil in 2012 with a mission to improve employee health and well-being.
- They enabled companies to provide their employees with access to 50,000 gyms in 11 different countries.
- In 2018 the company decided they needed to transform and hired an experienced product leader, Joca Torres, to help them build out their product organization and create tools with technology to automate many areas of the business.
- When the pandemic hit in 2020 they faced an existential crisis because gyms were closing and when it was most important to fight inactivity as we were all locked indoors it was impossible to get to a gym.
- Through their product discovery they had learned that many of their users were interested in wellness activities beyond gym-based fitness, such as, meditation, mindfulness, nutrition, and home-based exercise.
- They team quickly developed a series of prototypes to address the risk of value and viability.
- The company was able to roll out in 10 countries within four weeks and went from zero to hundreds of thousands of users in just a few months.

## Part VII - Transformation Story: Datasite

- Merrill was a legacy company that was sales centric.  
- What was sold determined what got built and was subject to who the salesperson was and the organization didn't have a cohesive vision or direction overall.  
- Innovation was lacking as a result and competitors were popping up with better value offers.
- Teams were given features to implement and not empowered to improve their products, they were mercenaries that were subservient to the needs of the sales team.
- The company had grown quite large not because of organic growth but through acquisition which coupled with a lack of strategic vision was missing core product focus.
- Their transformation meant building an internal engineering competency and investing in product teams and people and not specifically funding projects.
- They got rid of the "legacy roles" of product owner and business analyst, what would this look like for us?
- When everything is important there are too many priorities and problems won't get solved because the team lacks focus.
- The product vision needs to be big enough to last for years but the strategy should change as frequently as needed based on what is learned from the customers.
- Merrill's transformation, and ultimately rebrand to Datasite, has allowed them to produce value for it's customers nearly every day and the company increased revenue by more than 30% in 2019.

## Part VIII - Transformation Techniques

- Depending on the size of the organization it can take 6 months to 2 years to transform.
- The next set of chapters in this section are talking about tactics to help organizations transform to the product operating model.

### Chapter 28 - Transformation Outcome

- One of the primary focus shifts is that product teams are now accountable for results.
- In order to shift to this results focused outcome the organization must develop all of these other skills that allow teams to be empowered and give them the insights and context to generate those results.
- What do you hope to be able to do after transforming that you can't effectively do today?
- You can't say what specific goals are because we don't know what opportunities will present themselves for the teams to be able to pursue.

### Chapter 29 - Transformation Assessment

- An experienced product coach can assess a business unit in as little as one day because they know what to ask to who and what to look for.
- Some important caveats to keep in mind during an assessment are: 
    1. Be realistic - No organization is perfect and just because certain areas are not operating ideally does not mean the organization as a whole is not operating in the product model.
    2. Talk to all levels - Hearing something once doesn't mean it's gospel, some middle managers are surprisingly effective at obscuring information from top level leaders.
    3. Look for evidence - Verify they're not just talking the talk by asking to see things like OKRs, product vision and strategy, or prototypes. 
    4. Look below the surface - There's no one right way to do operate in the product model.  The most important consideration is if the organization is operating with product model principles.
    5. Be kind - The assessment is not focused on assessing individuals, it's used to assess the particular model being used to produce products.

#### High Level Assessment

- How are products being built and deployed?  This area focuses largely on release cadence, inter-team dependency, instrumentation, and tech debt.
- How are problems solved? This section focuses on how teams receive work, determine solutions, build those solutions, and validate that their solutions are having the desired effect.  Also, the question of does trust exist between the business and IT is here.
- How do you decide which problems to solve? This area focuses on who decides what work gets done, what the nature of that work is (i.e. delivering features or solving problems), and how success is measured (i.e. tracking results of updates vs raw number of features delivered).

#### The Detailed Assessment

With the understanding of how the company produces its products it's time to shift to looking at the specific product competencies and concepts within the organization and start identifying gaps.

- Product model competencies - Find out the overall size of the organization and what the rough numbers are of people in each role, which can be difficult since some roles have different titles or responsibilities and might need further details to determine where everyone is operating.
- Product management - Making sure the organization understands the difference between a product manager for an empowered team, versus a product manager for a feature team, versus a product owner for a delivery team.
- Product design - The three primary concerns here are: 1. Does the organization understand what a product designer is? 2. Does the organization have enough product designers for all of the product team's needs? 3. Are the product designers embedded in the teams?
- Engineering - The goal is not to assess the entire engineering department, but primarily assess how the Tech Leads are operating on product teams.  Do they interact with customers and help decide what gets implemented, not just how?
- Product Leadership - The product leadership should be engaged in helping product managers with strategic context and help them develop strategic vision and strategy for their teams with weekly coaching.

#### Product Model Concepts

Next is evaluating the concepts that are in place at the organization.  Most non-product model organizations will have some form of many of these concepts so the goal is to understand the most common situation.

- Product teams - Are the teams stable and long-lasting?  Do they focus on solving problems vs delivering features?  Are all of the cross-functional roles represented?  What's the level of ownership teammates feel?
- Product strategy - This can mean a lot of things, however, what we care about is if the team has a multiyear vision and is the team regularly developing strategic direction to solve problems from the business?  This is not "keep the lights on work", it is work that moves the product forward based on the product manager's direction.
- Product discovery - Is a team is testing the same number of ideas as items being built the team is likely engaging in product design, not discovery.  A team should be testing a large number of ideas, but implementing less than half of them.
- Product delivery - Are the teams releasing frequently enough and with the instrumentation necessary to determine if new features are working?  Do they have A/B testing?  Do the monitor systems to detect problems?
- Product culture - Are people more worried about following process than principle?  Are the engineers engaged in the innovation of the problem solving process?  Is failure in innovation something that keeps people from trying new things?

### Chapter 30 - Transformation Tactics - Competencies

Developing the new skills needed to create product model competencies is one of the first steps to transforming an organization and there's more detail on these techniques in the EMPOWERED book.

#### Product Model Competencies

- New job definitions - In order to coach team members into their new product model competencies you must first redefine the roles they operate in.  Changing titles to use product model terms without a meaningful change in responsibilities is doomed to fail.
- Job reset - If jobs currently exist with product model titles but not the competencies it's important to set a high bar and clearly communicate that to the company.  You might even temporarily change existing product role names to something else until they demonstrate they're capable of the new requirements and can be promoted into that role.
- Role balancing - Each product team should typically have one product manager, one product designer, and between 2 and 10 engineers.  Moving into the product model this balance will not be immediate typically and need to be sorted out.
- Dealing with too few designers - While hiring more product designers you can supplement the design team with contractors until the full time roles are filled or you can have the designers split between multiple teams.  Contribution falls off drastically when between more than 2 teams however.
- Dealing with outsource engineers - It's absolutely crucial to have dedicated in house engineers to be successful in the product model.  First and foremost the Tech Lead should be hired.
- Raising engagement levels of engineers - Engineers that stay on from pre-transformation have often been treated as mercenaries and are comfortable with this model.  They should be engaged in product discovery, problem solving, and engaging with customers.
- Product managers and line-of-business managers - When line-of-business managers continue to expect product managers to essentially be order takers they essentially become business analysts which is an abandonment of the product model altogether.  If the LOB manager does not trust the product manager to do the job perhaps the LOB manager could be the product manager with the right coaching.
- New recruiting practices -  Hiring managers need to take ownership of the recruiting process and determine how to hire the right people for their teams.  Moving to the product model often makes your organization more attractive to the type of talent you want to hire.
- Assessment and coaching plans - After getting the right people into the right spots you need to assess where the gaps are and create coaching plans to help address those gaps.
- Onboarding programs - Creating a product model onboarding program is a good way to educate people in this new mode of operation and can at key points even include the stakeholders.

### Chapter 31 - Transformation Tactics - Concepts

#### Product Teams

- Team chemistry - Strong team members doesn't necessarily mean strong team.  Figure out how to shuffle people around to get the most effective teams together.
- Team durability - Moving people between teams is at times necessary, but should be carefully considered and done as seldomly as possible to ensure long term cohesion.
- Review team topology - This should be created by product and engineering leaders together, should change infrequently, and should solve for the balance of the engineering and architecture needs as well as the customer and business needs.
- Dealing with distributed teams and remote employees - Co-location, even if only certain days, can be very beneficial for the collaboration between product managers, product designers, and tech leads.

#### Product Delivery

There are a ton of areas to invest in technically, including tech deb, CI/CD, DevOps, test and release automation, instrumentation, monitoring, and more.  Usually, it helps to have an engineer experienced in these things help implement it first on their team and then on the rest of the teams in the organization.  Many of these technical aspects are necessary for operating in the product model.

#### Product Discovery

Feature teams often think of their backlog as their "product discovery".  Feature teams don't usually tackle the value and viability aspects of a product and usually product managers can be apprehensive about taking on this responsibility.  It takes good coaching to get the product managers comfortable with their new role.

- Driving up customer interaction - Increasing interaction with customers is key.  Consider having each team that has a user-facing experience start with one hour product discovery sessions three times per week, every week.  This is essential to consistent innovation.
- Discovery sprints - Use 1 week sprints as design/discovery sprints that helps build trust and learn the mindset, principles, and techniques of product discovery.
- Hack days - These can be used to ramp up in prototyping generally with directed or undirected focus.

#### Product Strategy

The product vision and company objectives are inputs to the product strategy, and out of that comes a set  of problems to solve which are then assigned to product teams in the form of OKRs.

- Create product vision - Most feature organizations don't have a unifying product vision and need to create one as part of their transformation.  This product vision should be unifying for the whole company and be large enough in scale to be viable for 3 to 10 years.
- Create product strategy - Without a product vision there is also usually a lack of product strategy which must be created by developing the muscles for ongoing, insight driven product strategies.  A systems for making hard decisions with data driven insights is a must.
- Portfolio management - A common problem during transformation is a large set of existing legacy systems.  They should be categorized into 3 bucks which are sunset (stop supporting), sustain (keep them running), and invest (future bets).
- Funding product teams - It is necessary to shift from funding projects to funding product teams.  This is easiest done by instead of creating a business case for a project output over a given number of months, put together a business case for a product team to deliver an outcome for some number of quarters.
- Implementing team objectives - Strong product strategy creates a prioritized set of problems to solve which should take the form of OKRs so the team can measure success against the objective.
- Product vision or strategy sprints - A week long offsite-style collaborative meeting meant to take a deep dive into product vision and/or strategy to accomplish in a week what would otherwise take longer typically.

#### Product Culture

- Hack days - It's important to get the product teams engaged in innovative solutions to problems and hack days can help with that very important cultural shift.
- Customer engagement - Engaging with customers regularly offers key insights to what obstacles users face and better equips product teams to solve the problems that they face.
- Innovation accounting - How many ideas have been tested and what role have insights from the data played in helping form those insights?
- Cultural retrospectives - At least quarterly it's a good idea to get the best product, design, and engineering leaders together to discuss how well the organization managed to do it's previous quarter's work and what should be the focus of the next quarter.

### Chapter 32 - Transformation Tactics - Adoption

There are a number of different ways to approach adopting the product operating model.  They are varying and some of them can be blended based on the circumstances of the current organization.  Many factors are enumerated at the start of chapter 32 that are worth considering.

- Pilot teams - Since many people are resistant to change it can be beneficial to setup pilot teams that can implement the product operating model first and work out the kinks amongst the team and the new business relationships before rolling it out to the rest of the company.
- Product model dimensions - There are three primary dimensions that you can view change to the product model through and it might even make sense to have teams focus on one dimension or another to start including focusing on how you build products (product delivery), how you solve problems (product discovery), and how you decide which problems to solve (product strategy).
- Top down and bottom up - There's a lot to cover in a transformation, having one product leader focus on developing the product team skills (bottom up) and one product leader focusing on developing the product leader's skills and strategic context (top down) can help attack all areas at once.
- Coaching stakeholders - Each side of the product/stakeholder relationship may require coaching and stakeholders who are eager to test out the product model and have strong credibility in the organization are key candidates.
- Stakeholder briefings - Holding separate briefings on the product model with the stakeholders can give them a safe place to raise concerns and objects that need talked through without having a wider audience present.
- Managing existing commitments - When transforming there are likely a number of promises that have been made and must still be met.  You can either dedicate a subset of teams to handling these while the rest of the organization moves to the product model or have each team be responsible for both their existing commitments and the new product mode focused work.  Both have upsides and downsides and the work here is not to be confused with the "keep the lights on" work that exists before and after transformation.

### Chapter 33 - Transformation Evangelism 

- A transformation plan can take between 6 months and 2 years to complete and it can be easy to lose focus.
- Having named owners who are accountable to specific transformation work is key to making the transformation successful.
- Since transformation can take a long time it's important to build momentum by celebrating quick wins like killing an idea early based on a cheap experiment, teams that didn't work with customers before starting to visit with customers to gain important insights, or achieving an important business result.

#### Transformation setbacks to be mindful of
1. The CEO or Key Product Leader leaves and whoever fills the position is not bought into the vision of transformation or lacks the credibility to make it successful.
2. Scaling across company requires a fresh assessment for new business units as each area will require customized focus.
3. The PMO returns because someone ascends power and misses the old days of command and control.
4. Business climate changes create situations that can force people to adapt in times of crisis but afterwards people may fall back to old habits.

### Chapter 34 - Transformation Help

> "Coaching is no longer a specialty; you cannot be a good manager without being a good coach."  -Bill Campbell

- Hiring senior product leaders who have already worked in this model can help lead a transformation
- Sometimes hiring experienced leaders is not enough though if the company has a number of senior leaders who have never worked this way before or if the number of people who need coaching is too great for the leaders to be able to invest in all of them
- An alternative option can be to leverage external product coaches, or even in organizations large enough internal coaches, to help with transformation

#### External Product Coaches
- Delivery Coaches - Engineering professionals that help stand up the technology needed to release regularly.
- Discovery Coaches - Helping teams move into the empowered product team mentality and learning how to do product discovery well.
- Product Leadership Coaches - Focused on helping leaders in the organization develop product concept muscles like product vision, strategy, etc.
- Transformation Coaches - Walks the senior leadership team though all of the changes needed to shift mindset and culture.

### Chapter 35 - Innovation Story: Datasite

- Datasite's transformation was covered in an earlier chapter
- In this chapter they use their new found product model skills to innovate in the document redaction space
- In 2019 poorly redacted documents played a prominent role in a political news story which brought the need for a strong redaction tool in the merger and acquisition space to the forefront in order to maintain client confidence
- The product team worked with customers to identify their document redaction needs and evaluated several technical approaches and ultimately created a first in kind solution that is now patented technology for their organization

## Part IX - Transformation Story: Adobe

- Adobe historically operated on a 12 to 18 month waterfall cycle to release major software updates
- New players were being mentioned in their design space with customers constantly that enabled cloud functionality and regular updates
- Since Adobe already had a strong engineering and product culture already they set out to focus on changing how they build and solve problems
- In order to help them create a vision for the future of their design products they created a fictional designer that owned a small design firm and a scenario where she would be pitching a design to an interested party in Nike
- The first 2 major problems they focused on solving were getting a unified identity management system and providing a cloud synchronization mechanism across all of the devices owned by a user
- Teams internalized "Marissa's problems" and became passionate about solving them with their individual products
- Every part of the organization was impacted in some way 
- The success of their transformation moved Adobe from 6M Creative Suite customers to 26M Creative Cloud subscribers 

## Part X - Overcoming Objections

- This section of the book is dedicated to helping overcome objections that people may have with moving to the product operating model and helping to get them on board

### Chapter 36 - Objections from Customers

Objection: Our users believe that it's absolutely essential for you to provide this specific capability.  Unless you can commit to that, we can't commit to buying your product.

This often comes from a place of frustration because of previously undelivered promises.  It's important to understand the problem behind the demand and understand if you can solve there problem in a way that your core business is focused on.

Objection: I need to know when I can count on this feature being delivered.

If a feature is agreed to, before making any promises you should realize this is what high-integrity commitments are for.

Objection: We are making a major bet on your company if we purchase this product, and we need to make sure the direction you are going is where we want to go as well.  We need to see your product roadmap to know if that's the case.

It can be helpful to explain the risks of product road maps but often when addresses their concern will be your product vision and sharing that instead of a product road map is preferable. 

Objection: It is so much work to deal with your new releases, I can only handle them every 3/6/12 months.
Objection: We need thorough documentation and training for every new release.

The data overwhelmingly dictates that smaller and more consistent releases provide better stability and are much less disruptive to a user's workflow.  The changes are designed such that users are rarely impacted and when they are they do not need new training.

Objection: We are very uncomfortable with the idea that you are collecting data on our use of your products.  Why should we allow this?

Data is anonymized and aggregated so no PII is exposed.  This information is akin to a pilot relying on their instrumentation when flying a plane to make sure everything is working as expected.

Objection: We were working as part of a customer discovery program, and we were very excited about the progress, but then we were told that you decided not to pursue this new product.  Is this normal?  Did we do something wrong?

Sometimes the needs of a customer are specific enough that their needs don't make sense for the product's entire range of customers.

### Chapter 37 - Objections from Sales

Objection: We are the ones sitting down with the customers every day.  Why shouldn't we be the ones to tell the product team what needs delivered?

Strong product managers cultivate relationships with salespeople and ever interact with key customers to understand their needs better.  However, the customers and salespeople are not experts on enabling technologies and the product teams are there to solve their problems with the best technical solutions.

Objection: This is a great product vision, but it's years in the making.  I need to make my numbers now.  How will what's being built help my sales team make their numbers this quarter or next?

It's important to provide the sales force with things they can sell now.  Perhaps even provide them with referenceable customers that are using the latest offering and loving it.

Objection: I have a very promising prospect, but we need to commit to some new capabilities to close the deal.

Special requests should filter through the head of sales which can act as a filter to stop most one off requests.  In the event that the head of sales think the request is worth pursuing the product manager should understand the problem and if it fits into the current target market and product vision before proceeding.

Objection: We lost a big deal specifically because we are missing some key capabilities as compared to our competitors.  Why would that not be our top priority?

Often customers will point to a feature as an easy way to explain why they aren't choosing you.  Sometimes that reason is a critical missing piece for the platform and sometimes it's just an excuse.  It's up to the product manager to be able to determine which it is and if that feature should be built into the product.

Objection: We keep losing deals against this key competitor. What can we do to better compete?

There may be work underway that addresses those shortcomings but they may be a ways off.  It's up to the product manager and marketing to help point sales to opportunities to sell and highlight segments their product has that it is superior.

Objection: I work very hard to manage my prospects and customers, and I don't want people from product teams risking that.

It's absolutely necessary that the product teams have access to the customers to learn about their uses and needs.  When needed the product team members can receive training and coaching to help them learn how to appropriately interact in a customer facing event.

Objection: I want to make sure that we don't have random product teams contacting my customers every week without coordinating with each other, and especially without coordinating with me.

This request is reasonable and it's important that the product teams keep their sales and account managers in the loop on communication and that they don't all reach out to the same customers at the same time.

### Chapter 38 - Objections from the CEO and Board

Objection: As CEO, I meet with customers, investors, board members, analysts, and other company executives every day.  How would I not be the appropriate person to decide what the product teams should deliver?

Objection: I am the one responsible for the revenue so shouldn't I be the one to define the product roadmap for delivering that revenue?

CEO's are obviously in a very strong position to drive product and are often the heads of the product department as well.  However, empowered teams are central to the product operating model and are the most knowledgeable about technology and what is just now possible.  It's also not scalable to have the CEO make all product decisions.

Objection: I am trying to run a business.  I need to know what will be released and when it will happen.

Your strategic context will empower the teams to make good decisions while you are unavailable.  Teams will also provide details on what initiatives will be delivered when and what business outcomes they will affect.

Objection: My board wants to see our product roadmap.  I need to provide that to them.

The board doesn't care about a roadmap exactly, they care about how they work they're funding contributes to the target results.  It's up to the product leaders to make sure that the executive team understands how the product work ties directly to achieving these results.

Objection: What if I have a product idea?  Shouldn't I have a way to share that idea with the product team?

Ideas can come from anywhere and sharing ideas is great.  Be explicit though that it just that, an idea, and will need to be tested to see if it's good and should be turned in a feature or product.

Objection: What is a reasonable time frame in which to expect results from our product efforts?  How do I know if a product team is struggling or if things are just par for the course?

The product vision should spell out in narrative fashion what the results are and it should be clear to see if the product teams are achieving that or not.  As for if they are struggling, quarterly reviews or product leadership deep dives on product teams can discover if there are any issues that need addressed.

Objection: I want to make sure our organization is in alignment.  We need to make sure that product, marketing, sales, service, and operations are all headed in the same direction and coordinated.

This is why OKRs are so often used to make sure there is alignment for these goals on an annual and quarterly basis.

Objection:  The board says my investment ratios are off for my stage company.  They want more investment in sales (direct correlation to revenue) versus product (where revenue is ill-defined).  How do I defend increasing resources in product and not in sales?

If a product-market fit has been achieved this is often the right move, but until then it would be a waste of resources and you should instead be focused on developing a product-market fit with every resource possible.

### Chapter 39 - Objections from Line of Business

Objection: I have P&L responsibility for this product line.  So why would I not have control of the engineering resources?

Similarly to a CEO, a line-of-business manager will want to provide the product teams with product vision and strategy as well as what business outcomes the team should be targeting.

Objection: Leadership expects that I know about anything that can impact my business.  I need to know what's coming so I can answer those questions when they come to me.  I don't want to look like I don't know what's going on.

This is 100% true and just as it's important for line-of-business managers to share strategic context with the product team the team must also share as much information as possible, including emerging insights and learnings from the front lines and how the work they're doing will impact targeted business outcomes.

Objection: I find it so frustrating that the product team feels they need to repeat all the problem discovery that I've already done before they can get to work on the solution.  And furthermore, because of that, too often there's no time left for solution discovery.

It's important to bring along the product manager and designer for customer interactions that would be part of this process.  It is important for them to understand the problem in depth before being able to create solutions for it.

Objection: We need to move faster.  Speed is critical.  How can I get these product teams to feel the same sense of urgency I feel?

Speed is indeed critical, but with a focus on time to money not time to market.  If you create something that doesn't sell you've spent a lot to gain little.  Product teams should be able to test ideas in less than 1/10th the time it would take to build in order to find the best solution.

Objection: The product team is resistant to showing their early prototypes to us as stakeholders, before they think it is of the necessary quality and ready for final review.

Building trust between the product team and stakeholders can take time.  If the stakeholders only want to see finals then the team will likely be hesitant to share anything before it's ready.  But if the stakeholders are willing to recognize what step of the process the team is in and are willing to provide useful feedback the team may feel more comfortable sharing early ideas.

Objection: I prefer to have on my business team a set of people who report directly to me who can drive product initiatives.

Product managers should generally live in IT and report to product leaders that are capable of developing strong product leaders.  Outside of the product model it's not uncommon to have someone that fills a similar role that reports to the line-of-business manager but there is no need to have overlapping roles as this function moves to the product team.

Objection: I run the business, so I should create the product strategy.

Product strategy should look across business units to maximize value.  This requires transparent communication between the product leaders and line-of-business managers to make sure targeted business outcomes are being met.
