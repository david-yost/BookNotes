# Transformed

## Moving To The Product Operating Model

#### by Marty Cagan

### Chapter 1 - Who Is This Book For?

- This book is for anyone that is part of a company that is already, or planning, to operate with a product operating model.
- It's not important WHAT you sell, but how you design and build it as well as operate your business.
- The product operating model is for anyone that believes they should be powering their business with technology.
- If you haven't read INSPIRED or EMPOWERED this book provides the necessary foundation to make it useful to you still.

### Chapter 2 - What Is a Product Operating Model?

- The Product Operating Model (a.k.a product model) is about consistently creating technology-opowered solutions that your customers love and work for your business.
- The terms product-led or product-centric are often used interchangeably for product model but have the unfortunate side effect of implying that product is running the show.
- When determining what model a non-product company is using it's best to think who's in the driving seat? (i.e. IT, marketing, sales, etc.)
- Products are any technology-based systems, services, devices, tools, etc. that are created and managed by an organization, whether internal or external in focus.s

### Chapter 3 - Why Transform?

- There are typically 3 major drivers for companies that are looking to make a transformation: 
    - Competitive threats from the core market they support
    - Compelling prizes from successfully completing a product model transformation
    - Leaders that are frustrated with how slowly they're achieving and innovating
- Additional factors that can add pressure from a leadership perspective
    - Your start technology personnel are leaving out of frustration
    - There's new leadership that come from a product model background and are evangelising it
    - Loyal customers are expressing frustration with the lack of adaptation and improvement

### Chapter 4 - A Typical Transformation

- Many companies have attempted transformation before and have failed for various reasons but the story feels similar to an extent for all of them.
- The company finds initial success by specializing in delivery customized solutions based on what salespeople can sell.
- At a certain point you hit a critical mass of customized solutions and it's no longer tenable to maintain so many separate things and delivering new things slows to a crawl.
- New executives are hired with the promise of transforming the company by re-organizing and re-focusing the business vision.
- A whole new set of challenges arise as engineers are hired with competitive salaries and the product team is built out exceeding budgetary constraints.
- Year(s) into the transformation there's still slow moving progress and engineering is encouraged to refactor where they can and focus on delivering road map wins.
- More process is introduced with a focus on increasing predictable releases on a less frequent basis.
- A key number of the engineers that were hired on to make the transformation successful resign citing a lack of progress.
- A small remaining number of engineering and product leaders approach the CEO to try to address the technology needs that have been born out of technology mismanagement.
- The CEO has lost the support of the board and the transformation has failed.

### Chapter 5 - The Role of the CEO

- The CEO doesn't need to be experienced in the product model or spend a lot of time in the transformation itself, however it plays a critical role in the transformation.
- Transformation impacts every aspect of the business, not just engineering and product, and the stakeholders will ultimately look to the CEO for what's important.
- "The company cares about what the leader cares about." - Bill Campbell
- CEO's can't just delegate the transformation to a CIO or CTO because they aren't responsible for the entire organization.
- Transformation does require certain capabilities to be estiblished within product, design, and engineering but, the entire organization is needed for transformation.
- The CEO needs to be viewed as the chief evangelist of the product model, if they're not on board then your transformation readiness may need reassessed.

### Chapter 6 - A Guide to TRANSFORMED

- Each part in the book addresses a key portion of the learning process and uses success stories to illustrate what success looks like.
- Successful transformation is indeed hard to pull off and requires tackling tough issues even when those involved don't want to hear it.
- Product leaders have as much work to do to make a transformation at their company successful as the executives do.
- PRoduct leaders must taking responsibility for raising the skill levels of the product people.
- You have as much ownership as you have credibility and part of your job as a product leader is to change hearts and minds.

## Part II - Transformation Defined

Throughout the book we look at product model change along 3 different dimensions:
1. Changing how you build
2. Changing how you solve problems
3. Changing how you decide which problems to solve

#### Changing How You Build

The rise of so-caled fake agile lets companies trick themselves into thinking they are working the way they need to without actually improving how the build things in any real way.  We need to be instrumenting our technology, monitoring our platforms, and prove value before delivering capabilities more broadly.  If not using continuous delivery 2 week releases is the bare minimum.

#### Changing How You Solve Problems

Instead of perceived solutions being passed down to feature teams via a road map the product team is assigned problems to solve.  The team is empowered to discover a solution that is valuable, usable, feasible, and viable.  Decisions get pushed down tot he people closes to the technology to be enabled to solve the problems by rapidly testing ideas on the path to discovering a solution worth building.

#### Changing How You Decide Which Problems To Solve

A strong product company has a compelling product vision and an insight-based product strategy to identify the most critical problems that need to be solved to delivery on business objectives.  This requires strong product leaders that receive necessary coaching and strategic context.

### Chapter 7 - Changing How You Build

- Everything we build has two valuable outputs, what we create and what we learn.  In the project model we often lose most of what we learn.
- Teams that have to live with code they write will treat it differently than engineers that know they're rolling off lately.
- Product model operation requires releasing often, sometimes many times a day, and with instrumentation to make sure everything is operating as expected.
- Many companies have adopted agile methodologies in an effort to force smaller and more frequent releases, but agile is not required to accomplish this necessarily through CI/CD pipelines.
- If you're following agile processes but you're only releasing ever month/quarter/year you're still not agile and certainly not transformed.

### Chapter 8 - Changing How You Solve Problems

- Most industry analysts say that features and projects on roadmaps that generate a positive return on investment is only 10 to 30 percent.
- Feature teams are set up to serve the stakeholders in your business instead of your customers in ways that work for your business.
- In feature teams the project work that you take on is typically from business leaders or other stakeholders and if that project does not generate value it's not the engineering team's fault, it's the fault of the stakeholder that requested it.
- You can work backwards from feature asks to determine what underlying problems they're trying to solve, then figure out how it's going to be measured and what the desired outcome will be.
- Empowered teams not only improve morale, but empowered engineers are essential to innovation.
- Evidence of whether or not you have shifted how you view engineers philosophically is how many of them are outsourced versus other roles. 
- Time to market is important for product teams but time to money is more imporant (i.e. how long does it take to get an idea through product discovery and has the necessary impact).
- Prototypes to test ideas in product discovery should be at least one order of magnitude less expensive than using engineers to build, test, and deploy.
- It is much more difficult to take responsibility for solving problems than to just build what features/projects are put in front of you.
- Outcome-based roadmaps can be useful in forcing you to think about solving problems isntead of delivering features.  To do this you look at the outputs on a roadmap, figure out what problem each thing is hoping to solve and what the measure of success is.  This shifts you from features and dates focused roadmap discussions and to problems you need to solve and the outcomes you need to meet to solve them.

### Chapter 9 - Changing How You Decide Which Problems To Solve

- Moving from feature roadmaps to outcome roadmaps is a step in the right direction, but are they the most important probles to be solved for our company and our customers?
- Changing how you decide which problems to solve is the third dimension of movign to the product model.
- Product vision is describing the future you're trying to create.
- "The main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing." - Jim Barksdale, CEO
- "If you chase two rabbits, you will not catch either one." - Russian proverb
- Good product strategy is a force multiplier, and in a company with good go-to-market strategy and/or business strategy but not product strategy you cannot operate in the product model properly.
- There is not one right way to build products, the product model is a conceptual model and not a prescription or process with steps that guarantee success.

## Part III - Product Model Components

- Product teams exist to solve hard problems for your customers and for your business, in ways your customer love, yet work for the business.
- A challenge that can be a pitfall is implementing the new titles for a product model without learnign the core competencies that come with it.

#### Product Managers, Product Designers, and Engineers

To discover effective solutions for you product the team must address four different risks:
1. Value risk - Will the customer buy or solution or choose to use it?
2. Viability risk - Will this solution work for our business?  Is it something we can effectively and legally market, sell, service, fund, and monetize?
3. Usability risk - Can users easily learn, use, and perceive the value of the solution?
4. Feasability risk - Do we know how to build and scale this solution with the staff, time, technology, and data we have?

- Product Manager - responsible for the value and viability risks and achieving the targeted product outcomes.
- Product Designer - responsible for the usability risk and product experience.
- Tech Lead - responsible for the feasibility risk and product delivery.

#### Product Leaders

- These are the managers of product management, product design, and engineering.
- They are responsible for ensuring that the product organization is aligned witht he larger company in pursuing the best opportunities and addressing the most serious threats.
- If you don't have these people in place you should first hire them before starting your transformation.

### Chapter 10 - Product Mangers

- This is the most difficult competency to establish in a company trying to transform.
- One of the reasons this role is so messy is because it likely exists in a non-product model organization with different competencies and responsibiliities.
- A deep understanding of the users and customers is necessary to asses "value" and a solid understanding of the business is necessary to asses "viability".
- A clear sign that the product team doesn't have a competent product manager is the need to escalate decisions to a manager or a group of stakeholders.

Here are 2 candid realities to set the expectation for the level of skill a product manager should have:
1. Your head of product will be judged by his/her weakest product manager.
2. Your CEO should believe that each of your product managers has the potential to be a future leader of your company in the next five or so years.

- The product model collapses when you do not hold your product managers to a high enough bar, the team is missing needed cross-functional skills, the stakeholders don't trust the team, and the product teams can't deliver desired outcomes.
- In order to be successful, a product manager needs unencumbered access to three consituencies; users and customer, product data, and business stakeholders
- Produc thought leader Shreyas Doshi refers to true domain expertise as domain knowledge minus domain dogma.

### Chapter 11 - Product Designers

> "Design is not just what it looks like and feels like.  Design is how it works." -Steve Jobs

- Out of all of the design skills (service/interaction/visual/industrial), the most important for a product designer is proven interaction design knowledge and skills.
- Product designers are not just there to "make things pretty", they are there to help discover an effective solution!
- Not only do designers create experiences, but they intentionally design changes to those experiences.
- The skill level required for a good product designer in the product model should be on par with a product manager or engineer and compensated as such.

### Chapter 12 - Tech Leads

- The tech lead is an individual contributor, not an engineering manager.
- There are 2 dimensions that engineers are different in the product model versus others.
    1. Tech leads are much more involved in managing technical debt, performance, fault tolerance, scalability, etc.  Product engineers are not invested in these typically.
    2. Tech leads are invested in determining and building the right solution for the problem, not just implementing solutions that the product manager gives them.
- Engineers have to care just as much about what they build as how they build it.

> "If the tech lead is unable or unwilling to engage in product discovery, then you are very likely guaranteeing that the eventual product will not achieve your goals."

### Chapter 13 - Product Leaders

> "What gets in the way of good work?  There are only two possibilities.  The first is that people don't know how to do good work.  The second is that they know, but they aren't motivated." - Andy Grove, legendary CEO

#### Coaching
- It is the single most important responsibility of every people manager to develop the skill of their people.
- People within the organization should report to someone that is an expert in their craft, engineers to engineers, designers to designers, etc.
- How much time you spend coachign your people varies by the number and experience of their reports, but it's normal for first-level managers to spend 80% of their week on staffing and coaching.

#### Staffing
- Staffing includes sourcing, recruiting, interviewing, onboarding, evaluating, promoting, and replacing (when needed) members of the team.
- Doing this well take a lot of time and effort, can be difficult, and is likely not the type of product work you prefer to do.

> "Setting the bar high in our approach to hiring has been and will be the single most important element of Amazon's success." Jeff Bezos

#### Leadership
- You can leader a product organization by either command and control or by empowering the teams.
- Command and control means you are explicitly telling your team what to do, usual through a roadmap of projects and features.
- Empowering teams means you assign them business or customer problems to solve and let them determine how they're going to solve them.
- Pushing decisions down to the product team requires providing context, particularly on the product vision and strategy, to ensure they have the needed info to make good decisions.
- Product leaders are responsible for product vision, team topology, product strategy, and team objectives.

#### Product Vision
- The product vision describes the future you are tryuing to create as well as, most importantly, how the vision improves the lives of your customers.
- This is a shared goal of the product organization and usually has a time line that stretches forward between 3 and 10 years.
- The product vision is more art than science and is meant to persuade and inspire.

#### Team Topology
- This is how you define the responsibilities and ownership of the different product teams within the organization.
- Teams often have a topology that was unintentional and a reflection of the organization via Conway's Law (an anti-parttern for product operating model)
- Creating an effective team topology is crucial to success, but can be difficult and requires collaboration and negotiation with the heads of product, design, and engineering.

#### Product Strategy
- Product strategy describes how you plan to accomplish the product vision and meet the needs of the business along the way.
- This helps to get the most out of whatever product teams you have.
- The output of the product strategy is what business/customer problems you will solve.

#### Team Objectives
- Each team must have one or two clear objectives that are clear and can be executed (typically within a quarter)
- These objectives typically come directly from the product strategy and are a manifestation of the insights being turned to actions.
- The litmus test of empowered teams is if they are able to decide how to solve the problem objectives they have been assigned.

#### Ongoign Evngelism
- Communicating all of the things in this chapter across the organization.
- Doing this consistently requires constant communication in recruiting, onboarding, 1 on 1s, coaching, and company wide meetings.
- In each example studied in TRANSFORMED the CEO made sure to have strong leaders of product management, design, and engineering.

### Chapter 14 - Innovation Story: Almosafer

- Almosafe is a travel and tourism company based in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
- They started their transition to product model in 2018 to provide better regional service in their industry than the global services.
- This allowed them to build skills in continuously interviewing customers to identify unmet needs, collect and analyze data, and prototype and test ideas based on their findings.
- During COVID travel was crippled but in the need to gather in outdoor spaces with more room to spread out they found a niche in helping solve a new problem which was helping customers find and book istirahas (technically translates to resting place but is typically a large outdoor courtyard or other outdoor area).

## Part IV - Product Model Concepts

- These are product model concepts that you need to get right, one way or another, otherwise your transformation will likely collapse.

#### Product Model First Principles
These principles are the common beliefs of all product companies that operate well with this model, regardless if if they started that way or transformed to product model at some point.  Understanding these principles will also help evaluate processes, techniques, roles, and team members to know if they will be helpful or harmful in this product operating model.

#### Product Model Concepts
- Product Team - The foundation of the product operating model, these teams must be cross-functional.
- Product Strategy - Driven by insights that come from a strong and inspiring product vision.
- Product Discovery - This is how the product teams discover which solutions are worth building.
- Product Delivery - How product teams consistently, quickly, and reliably build solutions.
- Product Culture - Making sure the teams are experimenting and innovating to find solutions that work for the business and customers.

### Chapter 15 - Product Teams

- Empowered, cross-functional product teams are fundamental to the product operating model and it's where effective product innovation comes from.

#### Principle: Empowered with Problems to Solve

> "An empowered product team exists to solve problems in ways that your customers love, yet work for your business."

- A team is empowered when they are assigned a problem to solve, not a list of projects and features to build.
- Beign cross-functional means team members on the team can cover each of the product competencies necessary to come up with solutions.
- The product triad or troika is the product manager, product designer, and tech lead.

#### Principle: Outcomes over Output

> "At the end of the day, you know that unless the customer believes your new solution solves their problem sufficiently better than what they've been using, you fail."

- These teams are created to efficiently solve problems, not ship features that will never be used.
- At times, teams looking at data find that the best way to improve outcomes might be to actually remove functionality.

#### Principle: Sense of Ownership

> "If you want the product team to truly feel empowered and accountable, then you need them to feel a real sense of ownership over what they're responsible for."

- Each team needs to be responsible for something meaningful, whether it's a stand alone product or a subset of a much larger product.
- Teams need to be responsible for coming up with solutions for assigned problems and delivery of those solutions.

#### Principle: Collaboration

- Collaboration does not mean; product manager defines requirements, designer creates a design that meets those requirements, engineers build that design/feature as part of a sprint.
- Collaboration does not mean consensus or democracy, which is why it's important to practice "disagree and commit".
- Typically you defer the decision to the topic expert but in the case of a strong disagreement it's best to run a test.
- Collaboration is not about product managers creating artifacts, often times this is referred to as a requirement which ends the conversation and moves the discussion to implementation.
- Collaboration is not about compromise, a mediocre user experience, slow performance, and limited scalability you lose as a team.
- True collaboration is everyone bringing their skillset to the table to solve problems together and challenge each other's ideas.
- Designers have a deep understandign of the users and their behaviors.
- Engineers have deep insights into the enabling technology.
- Product managers have a deep understanding of the customers and the business.
- Collaboration means all product roles working together to come up with a solution that solves for all constraints.

### Chapter 16 - Product Strategy

> "If product teams are all about solving hard problems, then product strategy is all about how you decide which problems are most important to solve."

#### Principle: Focus

> "People think focus means saying yes to the thing you've got to focus on.  But that's not what it means at all.  It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are.  You have to pick carefully.  I'm actually as proud of the things we haven't done as the things I have done.  Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things." - Steve Jobs

- It's important for the product leaders to be transparent and not be perceived as having an agenda.
- Often, it's best for the CEO to select 2 or 3 of the most important goals to pursue, then the product leaders can focus on executing on those objectives.

#### Principle: Powered by Insights

> "Insights provide the leverage points that show you how to concentrate your efforts."

Primary source for insights:
1. Analyzing the data - How are your customers buying or using your products and is it changing over time?
2. Talking to your customers - What do they use today, what context can they share, what would it take for them to switch?
3. New enabling technologies - What can engineers solve today that they couldn't before?
4. The broader industry - What are competitors doing, what are trends, how are expectations changing?

- Product leaders should agreggate these insights and analyze them to help the product team come up with solutions.

#### Principle: Transparency

- Product leaders must be open and honest about sharing the reasoning and data behind the product strategy decisions they're making so the stakeholders aren't led to believe that they're pursuing their own agenda.
- Often times product leaders will need buy-in from different stakeholders in the organization.
- The benefit of this transparency is that the rationale for the product strategy is clear and the organization is aligned.

#### Principle: Placing Bets

- Even with the best product teams and leaders not every product will solve every problem every quarter like clockwork.
- Problems come in a variety of shapes and sizes and are being solved by teams with different levels of skill.
- If you have a critical problem to solve you can assign multiple product teams to solving it with the hopes that even one will yield significant progress on the business objectives.

### Chapter 17: Product Discovery

> "Product teams are responsible for both figuring out the best solution to the problems they've been asked to solve (product discovery), and then building and delivering those solutions (product delivery)."

#### Principle: Minimize Waste

> "The first principle in product discovery is to try to solve the problem with a minimum amount of wasted time and effort."

- The majority of solutions built (generally 70 to 90 percent) end up not delivering the necessary business results.
- Failure to deliver results is not only costly from an engineering hours spent perspective but also from an opportunity cost perspective.
- The key behind product discovery is testing out ideas quickly and finding solutions worthy building so you can get that solution to market.

#### Principle: Asset Product Risks

There are 4 primary risks in building products:
- Value Risk: Does it provide the necessary value to customers for them to choose it?
- Usability Risk: Can users figure out how to use it or is it too confusing?
- Viability Risk: Are there things preventing us from building it such as legal, cost, lack of market, etc.?
- Feasibility Risk: Can we actually build this product or will it take too long or are there other limiting factors?

> "Some problems you're working on have very minor risks, and others have several very major risks.  But every effort has risks that you need to consider."

- Assess the risks before you decide to build anything.

#### Principle: Embrace Rapid Experimentation

- Experimentation is necessary to know if customers would be able to learn and use something.
- A culture that embraces experimentation helps address risk and is central to innovation.
- Disagreements are common, and even a good sign, in the product model and experimentation helps resolve those disagreements with data instead of argumentation.
- Having team mates with skills in analyzing both qualitative and quantitative data will help validate the outcomes of these experiments.
- Building products with instrumentation is key to creating the datasets that allow this analysis to better inform decisions, without it we're flying blind.

#### Principle: Test Ideas Responsibly

- Small companies may be able to move quicker than larger companies but might lack the amount of traffick to generate meaningful results from an experiment.
- Larger companies may have more traffic, but if they are not correctly instrumenting their applications they will lack the data needed to inform decisions which is a necessary change.
- Larger companies also have a lot more to lose and should assess the risks, run experiments, collect data, and iterate quickly while making sure to protect things like: company revenue, reputation, customers, and your colleagues.

### Chapter 19: Product Delivery

> Reliability is our most important feature.

#### Principle: Small, Frequent, Uncoupled Releases

- At a minimum product teams should be releasing every other week, strong product teams release multiple times a day.
- The two main aspects you must test for releases are new feature functionality and regression.
- "Big Bang" releases are prone to delays because of the nature of integrating and testing hundreds or thousands of changes and the problems then cause when pulled together and are often plagued by defects after the fact.

> High Integrity Commitments - When you need to deliver a specific thing on a specific date, usually due to some sort of outside constraint like a partner relationship or a marketing campaign.  These date should not be set by anyone other than the people responsible for doing the work and often times it's best to create a feasibility prototype before committing.

#### Principle: Instrumentation

- Instrumentation is key at every level to understand the health and usage patterns of your system, otherwise you're flying blind.
- Good analytics and instrumentation can help you solve issues or spot user struggles without needing someone to report them.
- Understanding how your products are used and what improvements you need to drive is something that's never done and is always improving.

#### Principle: Monitoring

- Monitoring, also known as observability, happens at all levels and helps ensure your application is behaving correctly.
- This helps you surface system errors or issues often before customers really notice them.
- It's important to note that with both instrumentation and monitoring you need to be sure that no sensitive data is being logged.

#### Principle: Deployment Infrastructure

- Using infrastructure to A/B test new functionality is considered the "gold standard" for validating if a new feature has the desired effect or not, but depends on significant levels of traffic to be effective.
- Product teams that are doing this often run hundreds of tests simultaneously.
- It is not uncommon, given each companies unique and special needs, to have a combination of commercial and customer infrastructure to support their specific use cases.

> Technical Deb - Usually the result of acquisitions where you inherit the technical debt of an existing application or the fallout from older style project based funding for projects that don't think holistically about long term support or improvements.  The symptoms are work that should take days will take weeks or months.  The product model allows the teams to focus on improving this over time.  To get a good handle on tech deb you need to work on it daily, with about 10 to 30 percent of your engineering capacity.
