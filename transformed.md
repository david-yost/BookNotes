## Moving To The Product Operating Model

#### by Marty Cagan

### Chapter 1 - Who Is This Book For?

- This book is for anyone that is part of a company that is already, or planning, to operate with a product operating model.
- It's not important WHAT you sell, but how you design and build it as well as operate your business.
- The product operating model is for anyone that believes they should be powering their business with technology.
- If you haven't read INSPIRED or EMPOWERED this book provides the necessary foundation to make it useful to you still.

### Chapter 2 - What Is a Product Operating Model?

- The Product Operating Model (a.k.a product model) is about consistently creating technology-opowered solutions that your customers love and work for your business.
- The terms product-led or product-centric are often used interchangeably for product model but have the unfortunate side effect of implying that product is running the show.
- When determining what model a non-product company is using it's best to think who's in the driving seat? (i.e. IT, marketing, sales, etc.)
- Products are any technology-based systems, services, devices, tools, etc. that are created and managed by an organization, whether internal or external in focus.s

### Chapter 3 - Why Transform?

- There are typically 3 major drivers for companies that are looking to make a transformation: 
    - Competitive threats from the core market they support
    - Compelling prizes from successfully completing a product model transformation
    - Leaders that are frustrated with how slowly they're achieving and innovating
- Additional factors that can add pressure from a leadership perspective
    - Your start technology personnel are leaving out of frustration
    - There's new leadership that come from a product model background and are evangelising it
    - Loyal customers are expressing frustration with the lack of adaptation and improvement

### Chapter 4 - A Typical Transformation

- Many companies have attempted transformation before and have failed for various reasons but the story feels similar to an extent for all of them.
- The company finds initial success by specializing in delivery customized solutions based on what salespeople can sell.
- At a certain point you hit a critical mass of customized solutions and it's no longer tenable to maintain so many separate things and delivering new things slows to a crawl.
- New executives are hired with the promise of transforming the company by re-organizing and re-focusing the business vision.
- A whole new set of challenges arise as engineers are hired with competitive salaries and the product team is built out exceeding budgetary constraints.
- Year(s) into the transformation there's still slow moving progress and engineering is encouraged to refactor where they can and focus on delivering road map wins.
- More process is introduced with a focus on increasing predictable releases on a less frequent basis.
- A key number of the engineers that were hired on to make the transformation successful resign citing a lack of progress.
- A small remaining number of engineering and product leaders approach the CEO to try to address the technology needs that have been born out of technology mismanagement.
- The CEO has lost the support of the board and the transformation has failed.

### Chapter 5 - The Role of the CEO

- The CEO doesn't need to be experienced in the product model or spend a lot of time in the transformation itself, however it plays a critical role in the transformation.
- Transformation impacts every aspect of the business, not just engineering and product, and the stakeholders will ultimately look to the CEO for what's important.
- "The company cares about what the leader cares about." - Bill Campbell
- CEO's can't just delegate the transformation to a CIO or CTO because they aren't responsible for the entire organization.
- Transformation does require certain capabilities to be estiblished within product, design, and engineering but, the entire organization is needed for transformation.
- The CEO needs to be viewed as the chief evangelist of the product model, if they're not on board then your transformation readiness may need reassessed.

### Chapter 6 - A Guide to TRANSFORMED

- Each part in the book addresses a key portion of the learning process and uses success stories to illustrate what success looks like.
- Successful transformation is indeed hard to pull off and requires tackling tough issues even when those involved don't want to hear it.
- Product leaders have as much work to do to make a transformation at their company successful as the executives do.
- PRoduct leaders must taking responsibility for raising the skill levels of the product people.
- You have as much ownership as you have credibility and part of your job as a product leader is to change hearts and minds.

## Part II - Transformation Defined

Throughout the book we look at product model change along 3 different dimensions:
1. Changing how you build
2. Changing how you solve problems
3. Changing how you decide which problems to solve

#### Changing How You Build

The rise of so-caled fake agile lets companies trick themselves into thinking they are working the way they need to without actually improving how the build things in any real way.  We need to be instrumenting our technology, monitoring our platforms, and prove value before delivering capabilities more broadly.  If not using continuous delivery 2 week releases is the bare minimum.

#### Changing How You Solve Problems

Instead of perceived solutions being passed down to feature teams via a road map the product team is assigned problems to solve.  The team is empowered to discover a solution that is valuable, usable, feasible, and viable.  Decisions get pushed down tot he people closes to the technology to be enabled to solve the problems by rapidly testing ideas on the path to discovering a solution worth building.

#### Changing How You Decide Which Problems To Solve

A strong product company has a compelling product vision and an insight-based product strategy to identify the most critical problems that need to be solved to delivery on business objectives.  This requires strong product leaders that receive necessary coaching and strategic context.

### Chapter 7 - Changing How You Build

- Everything we build has two valuable outputs, what we create and what we learn.  In the project model we often lose most of what we learn.
- Teams that have to live with code they write will treat it differently than engineers that know they're rolling off lately.
- Product model operation requires releasing often, sometimes many times a day, and with instrumentation to make sure everything is operating as expected.
- Many companies have adopted agile methodologies in an effort to force smaller and more frequent releases, but agile is not required to accomplish this necessarily through CI/CD pipelines.
- If you're following agile processes but you're only releasing ever month/quarter/year you're still not agile and certainly not transformed.

### Chapter 8 - Changing How You Solve Problems

- Most industry analysts say that features and projects on roadmaps that generate a positive return on investment is only 10 to 30 percent.
- Feature teams are set up to serve the stakeholders in your business instead of your customers in ways that work for your business.
- In feature teams the project work that you take on is typically from business leaders or other stakeholders and if that project does not generate value it's not the engineering team's fault, it's the fault of the stakeholder that requested it.
- You can work backwards from feature asks to determine what underlying problems they're trying to solve, then figure out how it's going to be measured and what the desired outcome will be.
- Empowered teams not only improve morale, but empowered engineers are essential to innovation.
- Evidence of whether or not you have shifted how you view engineers philosophically is how many of them are outsourced versus other roles. 
- Time to market is important for product teams but time to money is more imporant (i.e. how long does it take to get an idea through product discovery and has the necessary impact).
- Prototypes to test ideas in product discovery should be at least one order of magnitude less expensive than using engineers to build, test, and deploy.
- It is much more difficult to take responsibility for solving problems than to just build what features/projects are put in front of you.
- Outcome-based roadmaps can be useful in forcing you to think about solving problems isntead of delivering features.  To do this you look at the outputs on a roadmap, figure out what problem each thing is hoping to solve and what the measure of success is.  This shifts you from features and dates focused roadmap discussions and to problems you need to solve and the outcomes you need to meet to solve them.
