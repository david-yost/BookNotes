### My Story: It Has Never Been About Retirement
JL Collins tells the story of his life and how he came to love working, being paid for that work and seeing his resources grow.  As he got older and built his family he learned how to properly manage and invest money in a way that helped he and his wife achieve financial freedom by building "F-You Money".  He made some mistakes, including thinking he could pick winning stocks better than the basic stock index, but said that overall three things saved him:
1. Saving 50% unwaveringly
2. Avoiding debt (even car payments)
3. Embracing the indexing lessons Jack Bogle perfected decades ago

### Thing Change; The Principles Remain
With all of the effort that the author put into this book, which was originally letters to his daughter trying to teach her his hard earned financial wisdom, she has come full circle and is now helping him to update this revision of his book which comes on the heels of the pandemic and all of the financial turmoil that attended it.  The principles in this book are financially sound and designed to stand the test of time over decades.  They are as true and valuable now as they were in the 70s when he started investing.

### Important Note On Projections
There are a few calculators used in the book to help illustrate points:

### Chapter 1 - Debt: The Unacceptable Burden
- Debt is the single most dangerous obstacle to building wealth
- Downsides to debt include:
    1. It diminishes your lifestyle because the more debt you carry the more of your income is dedicated to interest payments.
    2. Since your debt needs to be serviced you're enslaved to whatever income you have.
    3. You deal with a tremendous amount of emotional and psychological effects because of the burden.
    4. There are many parallels to the way addicts feel, both in the range of emotions and the fact that it's a self created prison.
    5. Some people turn to self medicating in some fashion to deal with the negative feelings and emotions only making the problem worse.
    6. Your focus on the past/present/future is consumed by your debt, how dumb the mistake was, how you're suffering today, and what lies ahead.
    7. The brain can sometimes close out the subject thinking it will be magically solved later, just ingraining debt into your lifestyle.

#### What to do about the debt you already have
- Less than 3%: Pay it off slowing and route the money to your investments instead.
- Between 3% and 5%: Do whatever feels most comfortable.  Either put the money to debt payment or investments.
- More than 5%: Pay it off ASAP.

#### How to start with paying off your existing debt
- Make a list of all your debts.
- Eliminate all nonessential spending (i.e. $5 coffees, $30 dinners, and $15 cocktails)
- Rank your debts by interest rate.
- Pay the minimum required on all debts, then focus on the highest interest rate debt first.
- Once the highest is paid off move onto the next and continue down the list until it's done.

### Chapter 2 - Why You Need F-You Money
- There are many things that money can buy, but the most valuable is freedom.  The freedom to do what you want and work for who you respect.
- Debt is a financial shackle that ties you to whatever work is in front of you so you can continue to service it.
- F-You money allows you to make your own decisions about your life and career with the freedom of knowing you have that F-you money to live on.

### Chapter 3 - Can Everyone Really Retire a Millionaire?
- The simple answer is a qualified "yes", but everyone's path can look different.  
- Even modest earners that start investing modest amounts young, but reinvest the dividends can get there over time.
- There are even extreme models where you try to cut you living expenses to the bone to maximize your savings over a tighter window.
- The key formula to saving and investing to build wealth is: **Spend less than you earn - Invest the surplus - Avoid debt.

### Chapter 4 - How To Think About Money
#### Level 1: It's Not just About Spending
- How we think about money affects where we end up financially. If given $100 would you think about what you could spend it on?  Invest it and spend the yearly returns?  Invest it and spend a smaller portion of the yearly returns than what it earns?  Or invest it and let it sit until the compounding effect has built enough wealth to be rich?
- When you spend money, not only is that money gone, but any money that money could have earned is gone as well.

#### Level 2: Consider Opportunity Costs
- Opportunity cost isx simply what you give up when you commit your money to one thing over another.
- A $25,000 car that in the VTSAX would earn a conservatively estimated $2,000 on the first year, but compounding over the following years so that the end of 10 year that estimated opportunity cost would be around $53,973.
- One of the beauties of being financially independent is that the power of compounding is greater than the opportunity cost of what you spend.
- If you are not currently financially independent and that's an attractive goal you would be well served to look at your spending through opportunity cost.

#### Level 3: How To Think About Your Investments
- Warren Buffett's famous rules: Rule #1: Never lose money.  Rule #2: Never forget rule #1.
- Many people misread Mr. Buffett's quote as him having figured out how to dance in and out of the market but that's not true.
- You can't view investments only in the moment of "I'm down 10%" or "I'm up 8%".  Long term investments will have events that cause downward trends but the market on average is moving up on the long term so momentary losses are always turned into long term gains if you don't realize those losses by pulling your money out.

### Chapter 5 - Investing In A Raging Bull (Or Bear) Market
**Some investment principles of the author:**
> 1. It is simply not possible to time the market, regardless of all the heavily credentialed gurus on CNBC and the like who claim they can.
> 2. The market is the most powerful wealth-building tool of all time.
> 3. The market always goes up, and it is always a wild and rocky ride along the way.
> 4. Since we can't predict these swings, we need to toughen up mentally and ride them out.
> 5. I want my money workin gas hard as possible, as soon as possible.

- Successful investment is by definition long term, anything in the short term is simply speculation.
