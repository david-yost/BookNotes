### My Story: It Has Never Been About Retirement
JL Collins tells the story of his life and how he came to love working, being paid for that work and seeing his resources grow.  As he got older and built his family he learned how to properly manage and invest money in a way that helped he and his wife achieve financial freedom by building "F-You Money".  He made some mistakes, including thinking he could pick winning stocks better than the basic stock index, but said that overall three things saved him:
1. Saving 50% unwaveringly
2. Avoiding debt (even car payments)
3. Embracing the indexing lessons Jack Bogle perfected decades ago

### Thing Change; The Principles Remain
With all of the effort that the author put into this book, which was originally letters to his daughter trying to teach her his hard earned financial wisdom, she has come full circle and is now helping him to update this revision of his book which comes on the heels of the pandemic and all of the financial turmoil that attended it.  The principles in this book are financially sound and designed to stand the test of time over decades.  They are as true and valuable now as they were in the 70s when he started investing.

### Important Note On Projections
There are a few calculators used in the book to help illustrate points:
- Calculator A - [S&P 500 Return Calculator with Dividend Reinvestment](https://dqydj.net/sp-500-return-calculator)
    - This is the one to use when you just want to know the S&P 500 returns for a particular period.
    - After entering the dates you're interested in, just click "Calculate" to see the data.
- Calculator B - [S&P 500 Periodic Reinvestment Calculator (with Dividends)](https://dqydj.net/sp-500-dividend-reinvestment-and-periodic-investment-calculator)
    - This one lets you see the impact of regularly investing any given amount.
    - To use it the way the author does, (1) enter your dates, your starting amount, and the amount of your ongoing investment, (2) click "Keep It Consistent", (3) click "Advanced", (4) click "Ignore Taxes" and "Ignore Fees" then (5) click "Calculate."
- Calculator C - [a basic investment calculator](https://www.calculator.net/investment-calculator.html)
    - This one allows you to see the results of entering various investment amounts, time periods, expected rates of return, and additional contribution amounts and when to make them.
    - Always start with the "End Amount" tab clicked.  Then just enter your inputs and click "Calculate."

### Chapter 1 - Debt: The Unacceptable Burden
- Debt is the single most dangerous obstacle to building wealth
- Downsides to debt include:
    1. It diminishes your lifestyle because the more debt you carry the more of your income is dedicated to interest payments.
    2. Since your debt needs to be serviced you're enslaved to whatever income you have.
    3. You deal with a tremendous amount of emotional and psychological effects because of the burden.
    4. There are many parallels to the way addicts feel, both in the range of emotions and the fact that it's a self created prison.
    5. Some people turn to self medicating in some fashion to deal with the negative feelings and emotions only making the problem worse.
    6. Your focus on the past/present/future is consumed by your debt, how dumb the mistake was, how you're suffering today, and what lies ahead.
    7. The brain can sometimes close out the subject thinking it will be magically solved later, just ingraining debt into your lifestyle.

#### What to do about the debt you already have
- Less than 3%: Pay it off slowing and route the money to your investments instead.
- Between 3% and 5%: Do whatever feels most comfortable.  Either put the money to debt payment or investments.
- More than 5%: Pay it off ASAP.

#### How to start with paying off your existing debt
- Make a list of all your debts.
- Eliminate all nonessential spending (i.e. $5 coffees, $30 dinners, and $15 cocktails)
- Rank your debts by interest rate.
- Pay the minimum required on all debts, then focus on the highest interest rate debt first.
- Once the highest is paid off move onto the next and continue down the list until it's done.

### Chapter 2 - Why You Need F-You Money
- There are many things that money can buy, but the most valuable is freedom.  The freedom to do what you want and work for who you respect.
- Debt is a financial shackle that ties you to whatever work is in front of you so you can continue to service it.
- F-You money allows you to make your own decisions about your life and career with the freedom of knowing you have that F-you money to live on.

### Chapter 3 - Can Everyone Really Retire a Millionaire?
- The simple answer is a qualified "yes", but everyone's path can look different.  
- Even modest earners that start investing modest amounts young, but reinvest the dividends can get there over time.
- There are even extreme models where you try to cut you living expenses to the bone to maximize your savings over a tighter window.
- The key formula to saving and investing to build wealth is: **Spend less than you earn - Invest the surplus - Avoid debt.

> VTSAX - Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund which has on average a 12.2% annual return over the last half century.

### Chapter 4 - How To Think About Money
#### Level 1: It's Not just About Spending
- How we think about money affects where we end up financially. If given $100 would you think about what you could spend it on?  Invest it and spend the yearly returns?  Invest it and spend a smaller portion of the yearly returns than what it earns?  Or invest it and let it sit until the compounding effect has built enough wealth to be rich?
- When you spend money, not only is that money gone, but any money that money could have earned is gone as well.

#### Level 2: Consider Opportunity Costs
- Opportunity cost isx simply what you give up when you commit your money to one thing over another.
- A $25,000 car that in the VTSAX would earn a conservatively estimated $2,000 on the first year, but compounding over the following years so that the end of 10 year that estimated opportunity cost would be around $53,973.
- One of the beauties of being financially independent is that the power of compounding is greater than the opportunity cost of what you spend.
- If you are not currently financially independent and that's an attractive goal you would be well served to look at your spending through opportunity cost.

#### Level 3: How To Think About Your Investments
- Warren Buffett's famous rules: Rule #1: Never lose money.  Rule #2: Never forget rule #1.
- Many people misread Mr. Buffett's quote as him having figured out how to dance in and out of the market but that's not true.
- You can't view investments only in the moment of "I'm down 10%" or "I'm up 8%".  Long term investments will have events that cause downward trends but the market on average is moving up on the long term so momentary losses are always turned into long term gains if you don't realize those losses by pulling your money out.

### Chapter 5 - Investing In A Raging Bull (Or Bear) Market
**Some investment principles of the author:**
> 1. It is simply not possible to time the market, regardless of all the heavily credentialed gurus on CNBC and the like who claim they can.
> 2. The market is the most powerful wealth-building tool of all time.
> 3. The market always goes up, and it is always a wild and rocky ride along the way.
> 4. Since we can't predict these swings, we need to toughen up mentally and ride them out.
> 5. I want my money working as hard as possible, as soon as possible.

- Successful investment is by definition long term, anything in the short term is simply speculation.

### Chapter 6 - There's A Major Market Crash Coming!!!! And Even Famous Economists Can't Save You
- An economist quoted by the author at the beginning of the chapter suggests that markets have become more volatile recently and the best way to combat that is to hold a broad spectrum of assets. This not only requires significantly more time investment to manage properly but is also likely to perform worse with the promise of more security.
- The author's advice: "Toughen up, cupcake, and cure your bad behavior."

**A few thins to understand about the stock market**
- Market crashes are not abnormal and are to be expected across long term investments. 
- The market always recovers.  Always.  And if someday it doesn't, no investment interest will be safe.
- The market always goes up.  Always.  Not every day, week, month, or even year.  If you look at the market over it's long term existence though, it's always relentlessly trending upwards, even if there are a few bumps along the way.
- The market is the single best-performing investment class over time, bar none.
- The upcoming decades will have just as many catastrophic events as the past.  It will be tempting to sell during those down swings, but only those with enough nerve to stay will prosper.
- Toughen up, ignore the noise, ride out the storm, and continue adding to your investments.
- Be emotionally and intellectually prepared for these market dives.
- There's a major market crash coming, and there will be another after that.

### Chapter 7 - The Market Always Goes Up
- The author shares his own story of losing his nerve and selling in the Black Monday crash of '87 when it was practically bottomed out.
- Buying out and realizing those losses meant that buying back into the market when it started to rise exacted a heavy price.
- Through disaster after disaster, the market continues it's long wild right relentlessly up and to the right.

**Two basic reasons that the market always goes up**
1. The market is self cleansing - That is to say that companies rise and fall.  Previously successful companies may some day be replaced by a new rising star.  It's important to note that this only works for broad based index funds.  When "professional management" tries to beat the system there is no guarantee that those attempts will be successful.
2. Owning stock is owning a part of living, breathing, dynamic companies, each striving to succeed - Owning stock is literally owning a piece of all of those companies that are trying so desperately to succeed.  In broad based index funds, as mentioned in point one, some companies will rise and some will fall, but ultimately will always trend upwards.

### Chapter 8 - Why Most People Lose Money In The Market
1. We think we can time the market.  Pulling your money out when the market is high and buying when it is low seems appealing but it's almost impossible to do this accurately and with any regularity.
2. We believe that we can pick individual stocks.  It's a great rush when you're right as well as incredibly addicting, but being able to beat the index year after year, even by a small margin, is incredible difficult.
3. We Believe we can pick winning mutual fund managers.  Around 7% of mutual funds will fail each year, and of those that do survive only around 17% will outperform their benchmarks which means that most are likely to do worse than indexed funds.
4. We focus on the foam.  In the analogy of a beer poured into a dark mug in another room, you don't know how much is beer and how much is foam when put in front of you.  The beer is the actual operating business of which we can own a part in the market and the foam is the volatile moment to moment rise and fall of particular companies.  The foam is distracting, and while it may have an impact on the moment it's better to focus on the long term view of the market.

### Chapter 9 - The Big Ugly Event
- The crash of 1929 was the worst financial collapse the market has ever seen.
- There are two possible economic disasters that can destroy wealth on a major scale, the first is a deflationary depression like 1929, the second is hyperinflation.
- During a deflationary cycle you're incentivized to wait to purchase something like a house because the longer it trends downward the cheaper real estate gets and the rates of purchasing a house, while inflationary environments encourage buying now because tomorrow it might be more expensive.
- The VTSAX wealth-building strategy hedges somewhat against inflation assuming the market follows the inflationary trend.

### Chapter 10 - Keep It Simple: Considerations and Tools
**Three Considerations**
1. In what stage of your investing life are you?  The wealth accumulation stage or the wealth preservation stage?  Or perhaps a blend of the two?
2. What level of risk do you find acceptable?
3. Is your investment horizon long term or short term?

- There is no such thing as risk-free investment, even if you put your money in an insured bank account your interest may not outpace inflation which could reduce your spending power.
- Your investment stage is not tied to your age, but rather wether you are adding to your investments or calling upon them to provide income for you.
- F-You money is critical and requires being consistent about building it, it's never too late to start.
- Don't be too hasty to think short term, life expectancy is continually increasing and depending on how early you retire you could have a long investment horizon.

**The Three Tools**
1. Stocks: VTSAX (Vanguard Tool Stock Market Index Fund).  Stocks provide the best returns over time and serve as our inflation hedge.  This is our core wealth building tool.
2. Bonds: VBTLX (Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund).  Bonds provide income, tend to smooth out the rough ride of stocks, and serve as our deflation hedge.
3. Cash: Cash is good to have around to cover routine expenses and meet emergencies.  Cash is also king during times of deflation.  The more prices drop, the more your cash can buy.

 ### Chapter 11 - Index Funds Are Really Just For Lazy People, Right?
 - Index investing is not for lazy people, it's for people who want the best possible results.
 - Buying all the stocks in the market index reliably and consistently outperforms professional management, especially when taking costs into consideration.
 
 **Why do so may resist the idea of indexing?**
 1. Smart people don't like to accept that they can't outperform the market by making smart picks.
 2. People think of "average" as a less-than status that they want to be better than.  Buying the market index is not an "average" in the sence that it is a midpoint, it is the combined performance of all stocks in an index.
 3. Financial media has many stories of successful managers that outperform the indexes in the short-term, but investing is a long term game.
 4. People underestimate the financial drag of the cost to investing with a fund manager.
 5. Often times people are looking for quick results and excitement.
 6. There's a lot of business in selling advice and brokering trades for people that you can convince you can outperform the market.

 ### Chapter 12 - Bonds
 Here are the stages of owning bonds as explained by this chapter:
- Stage 1 - Bonds as part of our portfolio provide a deflation hedge.
- Stage 2 - Buying bonds means you are loaning money to a company or government agency, whereas with stocks you're purchasing a part of that company.
- Stage 3 - Buying bonds in an index fund like VBTLX mitigates most of the risk of holding certain bonds.
- Stage 4 - The 2 key elements of bonds are the interest rate and the term.
- Stage 5 - Interest rate risk is another risk factor, as interest rates rise the value of your bond falls, but the reverse is also true.
- Stage 6 - The third risk factor is the term, the longer the term for the bond the more likely interest rates are to change significantly and impact the value of your bond.
- Stage 7 - Inflation is the biggest risk to the bond, as inflation rises so too does the interest paid on a bond which means your previously issued bond is worth less.
- Stage 8 - Some other risks include credit downgrades, callable bonds (i.e. the borrower can end it before it reaches maturity), liquidity risk.
- Stage 9 - Municipal bonds are government issued and will often avoid taxation.
- Stage 10 - There are innumerable types of bonds with so many variables at play but since this book is focused on index fund bonds there is no more specifics to dive into.

### Chapter 13 - Portfolio Ideas To Build And Keep Your Wealth
- The wealth accumulation portfolio is focused on building investments in the index fund and leaving it.  What the author likes to call the "Put all your eggs in one basket and forget about it" approach.  As long as you can resist the urge to fiddle with it.
- Using an index fund that has holdings across the market leverages the self-cleansing nature of the market where failures fall away and winners can grow endlessly.
- A holding with 10-25% bonds and 75-90% stocks will slightly outperform the 100% stock holding.
- The wealth preservation portfolio is going to be more diversified with a higher percentage fo the holdings in bond market index funds and cash reserves federal money market funds.  The author's break down is 75% stocks, 20% bonds, and 5% cash.

### Chapter 14 - Selecting Your Asset Allocation
- The two primary stages in managing your portfolio, the wealth accumulation stage and the wealth preservation stage, and using the index funds for stocks and bonds you can balance depending on your current stage but you'll also want to consider the factors of effort and risk tolerance.
- If you want to apply the effort of managing your portfolio to balance out the stocks/bonds ratio to include 10-25% bonds or rebalance any time the market makes a major move (+/- 20%) by selling from the better performing asset to buy shares in the lagging asset, ideally in an IRA or 401(k) to avoid capital gains tax which is a huge drawback and another reason to just focus on stocks.
- How much risk can you handle?  If you have flexibility in your spending habits and lifestyle you have more tolerance for risk than if every penny of your income is spent on keeping the lights on.

**Some additional questions after considering effort and risk**
1. When should I make the shift into bonds?
2. Does age matter?
3. Is there an optimal time of year to rebalance?
4. I have some of my investments in tax-advantaged accounts.  How can I rebalance across those?
5. Does more frequent reallocation improve performance?

### Chapter 15 - International Funds
**Reasons why "The Simple Path To Wealth" doesn't include international funds**
1. Added Risk - The currency risk of the country you're trading in and how it's value fluctuates against the dollar.  Also, account risk since not every country offers transparent accounting standards.
2. Added Expense - VTSAX has a 0.04% expense ratio for rock bottom costs while cheaper funds have expense ratios at least double that.
3. We've Got It Covered - The largest companies in the top 500 of the VTSAX generate 50% or more of their sales and profits overseas, giving you access to growth in world markets without most of the additional risk.  The world economy is also more closely knit than it ever has been which means that instead of an international economy booming when the US is down they are more likely to coincide with each other. 

### Chapter 16 - TRFs: The Simplest Path To Wealth Of All
- TRF - Target Retirement Funds
- These are funds of funds that combine stock and bond markets and automatically balance them as you approach your retirement date.
- If you want the fund to adjust more conservatively (greater percentage of bonds) then pick an earlier retirement date.
- TRFs can be great for a one stop shop solution to investing if you don't want to manually invest and balance between stocks and bonds.

### Chapter 17 - What If You Can't Buy VTSAX?  Or Even Vanguard?
- The VTSAX has rock bottom expense ratios but a minimum $3000 investment.
- The exact same portfolio held by VTSAX can be found in five funds: VTSAX, ETF, VITSX, VSMPX, VSTSX
- If your employer doesn't offer a 401(k) through VTSAX you want to look for the following alternatives:
    1. A low cost index-fund
    2. For tax-advantaged funds you'll be holding for decades total stock market index funds are preferred but S&P 500 index funds are fine
    3. Also look for total bond market index funds if your needs call for it
    4. TRFs are frequently offered and can be an excellent choice but look at the fees closely

### Chapter 18 - What Is It About Vanguard?
1. What makes Vanguard so special? - Vanguard is client owned and operated at cost.
2. Why are you comfortable holding all of your assets in one company? - The assets are not invested in Vanguard, they are invested in the mutual fund so even if Vanguard were to implode the underlying investments would remain unaffected.
3. What if Vanguard gets nuked? - There's a certain level of catastrophe that cannot be mitigated, but Vanguard has multi-site data redundancy and a disaster recovery plan in case of the worst.
4. Is the author on the take? - No Vanguard does not pay him.

### Chapter 19 - The 401(K), 403(B), TSP, IRA, and Roth Buckets
- There are 2 types of buckets that hold your investments: ordinary buckets, and tax-advantaged buckets.
- Note that tax-advantaged (or tax-deferred) doesn't mean that you do not pay tax, just when the tax is due.
- There are some strategies that seek to access this money tax-free by structuring your earned and investment income to fall under the IRS tax-free limits, which would still be legally subject to tax but the bracket it falls in would have an actual owed amount of zero.  There are many resources listed in this chapter for these strategies.
- Employer based tax-advantaged buckets often have matching and should be taken advantage of at least to the matching amount and up to the yearly max.

**Author's basic hierarchy for deploying investment money:**
1. Fund 401(k)-type plans to full employer match
2. Fully fund a Roth if your income is low enough that you are paying little or no income tax
3. Once your income tax rate rises, fully fund a deductible IRA rather than a Roth
4. Keep the Roth you started and just let it grow
5. Finish funding the 401(k)-type plan to the max
6. Consider funding a nondeductible IRA if your income is such that you cannot contribute to a deductible IRA or Roth IRA
7. Fund your taxable account with any money left
