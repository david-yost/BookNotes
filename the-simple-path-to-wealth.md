## My Story: It Has Never Been About Retirement
JL Collins tells the story of his life and how he came to love working, being paid for that work and seeing his resources grow.  As he got older and built his family he learned how to properly manage and invest money in a way that helped he and his wife achieve financial freedom by building "F-You Money".  He made some mistakes, including thinking he could pick winning stocks better than the basic stock index, but said that overall three things saved him:
1. Saving 50% unwaveringly
2. Avoiding debt (even car payments)
3. Embracing the indexing lessons Jack Bogle perfected decades ago

## Thing Change; The Principles Remain
With all of the effor that the author put into this book, which was originally letters to his daughter trying to teach her his hard earned financial wisdom, she has come full circle and is now helping him to update this revision of his book which comes on the heels of the pandemic and all of the financial turmoil that attended it.  The principles in this book are financially sound and designed to stand the test of time over decades.  They are as true and valuable now as they were in the 70s when he started investing.
