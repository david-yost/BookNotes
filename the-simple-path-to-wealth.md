### My Story: It Has Never Been About Retirement
JL Collins tells the story of his life and how he came to love working, being paid for that work and seeing his resources grow.  As he got older and built his family he learned how to properly manage and invest money in a way that helped he and his wife achieve financial freedom by building "F-You Money".  He made some mistakes, including thinking he could pick winning stocks better than the basic stock index, but said that overall three things saved him:
1. Saving 50% unwaveringly
2. Avoiding debt (even car payments)
3. Embracing the indexing lessons Jack Bogle perfected decades ago

### Thing Change; The Principles Remain
With all of the effort that the author put into this book, which was originally letters to his daughter trying to teach her his hard earned financial wisdom, she has come full circle and is now helping him to update this revision of his book which comes on the heels of the pandemic and all of the financial turmoil that attended it.  The principles in this book are financially sound and designed to stand the test of time over decades.  They are as true and valuable now as they were in the 70s when he started investing.

### Important Note On Projections
There are a few calculators used in the book to help illustrate points:
- Calculator A - [S&P 500 Return Calculator with Dividend Reinvestment](https://dqydj.net/sp-500-return-calculator)
    - This is the one to use when you just want to know the S&P 500 returns for a particular period.
    - After entering the dates you're interested in, just click "Calculate" to see the data.
- Calculator B - [S&P 500 Periodic Reinvestment Calculator (with Dividends)](https://dqydj.net/sp-500-dividend-reinvestment-and-periodic-investment-calculator)

### Chapter 1 - Debt: The Unacceptable Burden
- Debt is the single most dangerous obstacle to building wealth
- Downsides to debt include:
    1. It diminishes your lifestyle because the more debt you carry the more of your income is dedicated to interest payments.
    2. Since your debt needs to be serviced you're enslaved to whatever income you have.
    3. You deal with a tremendous amount of emotional and psychological effects because of the burden.
    4. There are many parallels to the way addicts feel, both in the range of emotions and the fact that it's a self created prison.
    5. Some people turn to self medicating in some fashion to deal with the negative feelings and emotions only making the problem worse.
    6. Your focus on the past/present/future is consumed by your debt, how dumb the mistake was, how you're suffering today, and what lies ahead.
    7. The brain can sometimes close out the subject thinking it will be magically solved later, just ingraining debt into your lifestyle.

#### What to do about the debt you already have
- Less than 3%: Pay it off slowing and route the money to your investments instead.
- Between 3% and 5%: Do whatever feels most comfortable.  Either put the money to debt payment or investments.
- More than 5%: Pay it off ASAP.

#### How to start with paying off your existing debt
- Make a list of all your debts.
- Eliminate all nonessential spending (i.e. $5 coffees, $30 dinners, and $15 cocktails)
- Rank your debts by interest rate.
- Pay the minimum required on all debts, then focus on the highest interest rate debt first.
- Once the highest is paid off move onto the next and continue down the list until it's done.

### Chapter 2 - Why You Need F-You Money
- There are many things that money can buy, but the most valuable is freedom.  The freedom to do what you want and work for who you respect.
- Debt is a financial shackle that ties you to whatever work is in front of you so you can continue to service it.
- F-You money allows you to make your own decisions about your life and career with the freedom of knowing you have that F-you money to live on.

### Chapter 3 - Can Everyone Really Retire a Millionaire?
- The simple answer is a qualified "yes", but everyone's path can look different.  
- Even modest earners that start investing modest amounts young, but reinvest the dividends can get there over time.
- There are even extreme models where you try to cut you living expenses to the bone to maximize your savings over a tighter window.
- The key formula to saving and investing to build wealth is: **Spend less than you earn - Invest the surplus - Avoid debt.
