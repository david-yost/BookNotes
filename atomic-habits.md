# Atomic Habits

## An Easy & Proven Way, to Build Good Habits & Break Bad ones

#### by James Clear

### Introduction

James tells the story of how he came about becoming interested in the topic of developing good habits and breaking bad ones. When he was in 10th grade he was hit in the face with a baseball bat that resulted in a pretty traumatic brain injury. He was flown to a Cincinnati hospital where they had to medically induce a coma to perform life saving surgery.

After his recovery he was unable to meet his pre-injury expectations and did not make varsity the next year for baseball. When he did as a senior he barely plaid 11 innings for the whole season. In college he was able to make the team as a freshman but would see little to no playing time. He used this time to start experimenting with habits and creating good patterns of behavior in his life which led him down a very successful path in his college baseball team and beyond.

He began writing after college and went from writing a small news letter to 1000 people to writing a book that's now a #1 New York Times best seller, creating a coaching agency, being quoted by prestigious publications regularly, and professional coaches teaching his approaches to their teams. His personal investigation into habit building has led him to a successful career and the science and framework of what he's learned is in this book.

### 1 - The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits

British cycling has a pivotal moment in it's history in 2003. After decades of a losing tradition hired Dave Brailsford as its new performance director which brought a strategy to the team he referred to as "the aggregation of marginal gains". The primary idea of this strategy is to find a marginal gain in everything you do and the sum of those gains is substantial. He focused on a 1% gain in everything from redesigned bike seats to the best massage gel to use for muscle recovery to the best pillow and mattress combinations for each rider's ideal sleep. Main more small changes were made on top of these leading to a massive success in the decade between 2007 and 2017 with 178 world championships, 66 Olympic or Paralympic gold medals, and 5 Tour de France victories.

The anser to this success is the marginal improvements, aggregated, and applied consistently over long timelines. If you aim for a 1% improvement every day over a year it will yield a 37 fold increase. Conversely, if you have a 1% decline in you habits every day of the course of a year it will flatline. Small changes do not seem to matter in the moment but applied consistently over time will have big impacts.

> "Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits."

Using the ice analogy from the book, an ice cube in a cold room may not melt immediately upon raising the temperature of the room by 1 degree. If the room is at 10 degrees raising it by 1 will make it only 11 degrees which is not warm enough to melt the ice. Continuing to raise the room a degree at a time will eventually hit 32, then 33 degrees and the ice will start melting. The window between the start of that 1 degree increase and when you actually see the ice to melt, or from a habit perspective when you start to make a small change and then see a recognizable result, is called the Plateau of Latent Potential.

> "Complaining about not achieveing success despite working hard is like complaining about an ice cube not melting when you heated it from twenty-five to thirty-one degrees. Your work was not wasted it was just being stored. All the action happens at thirty-two degrees."

Focusing on goals is not a recipe for creating success, focusing on systems is. While goals are good to have and can indeed help shape the system that may help us reach them, the systems are the driving force behind that change and success we are seeking. There are 4 major problems to focusing strictly on goals:

1. Winners and losers often will have the same goals. Every silver medalist presumably had a goal of winning gold.
2. Achieving a goal is only a momentary change. Once you clean your room if you have not changed your habits you're likely to end up with a messy room again.
3. Goals restrict your happiness. If you're focused on a future point in time and meeting that goal your happiness is tied up in the future. Focusing on the system allows you to be happy every day when your system is working.
4. Goals are at odds with long-term progress. Once the motivation for the goal you were chasing is gone, without a system to perpetuate that behavior the gains are often lost creating a yo-yo effect.

> "You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems."

### 2 - How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa)

There are three types of change, outcome based, process based, and identity based.

1. Oucome - This focuses on achieving results, also known as a specific outcome. Something like weight loss, salary growth, or running a marathon. What you get.
2. Processes - These are focused on chaning a routine like making a bed, cleaning a desk, updating a workout program. It's the most common way habits built are associated. What you do.
3. Identity - The focus here is your belief or view of who you are. Most of your beliefs, assumptions, and biases are associated with this tier. Who you are.

If you think about these layers of change as a circle where identity is at the core, processes are wrapped around that, and outcomes are the outermost layer you get a picture of how habits are formed. Most people start with what outcome they want and work their way inward which is a less successful model for habit change because if you don't change your identity, or how you see yourself, you're less likely to follow through with maintaining good habits. If you start from the center with identity, who you want to become, and base the processes on that new vision of yourself the outcomes will come from those changes as a result of your new vision of yourself.

Exmaples of shifting from an outcome focus to an identity focus:

- The goal is not to read a book, the goal is to become a reader.
- The goal is not to to run a marathon, the goal is to become a runner.
- The goal is not to learn an instrument, the goal is to become a musician.

These identities can also be negative impacts on our lives. For instance:

- I'm terrible with directions
- I'm not a morning person (ouch)
- I'm bad at remembering people's names (double ouch)

When you accept these as norms for your identity you fall into these behavioral patterns. It becomes self-fulfilling.

#### The Two-Step process to changing your identity

1. Decide the type of person you want to be.
2. Prove it to yourself with small wins.

Each action that validates the identity you have for yourself is like casting a vote for that identity. That identity doesn't have to win unanimously, everyone will make mistakes, but if you're voting for that identity a majority of the time with your actions or habits then you see success. Each time you write a page, you are a writer.

#### The real reason habits matter

> "Are you becoming the type of person you want to become?"

The first step is not the what or the how, but who. Starting with who you want to be is the north start for all habit building and decisions. As you build habits and achieve these wins with actions that line up with your identity you start to prove it to be true and become the person you want to be.

### 3 - How To Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps

> "behaviors followed by satisfying consequences tend to be repeated and those that produce unpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated."
> Edward Thorndike

#### Why your brain builds habits

Habits are pre-programmed actions that your brain defaults to when a particular problem arises. When we are solving a problem, we are actively engaged in the act of thinking through possible solutions and paths forward. As we continue to solve that problem over and over again our brain hands over the response to those problems to our subconscious to free up cognitive load to focus on whatever is most pressing.

> "Habits are, simply, reliable solutions to recurring problems in our environment."
> Jason Hreha

Habits do not restrict freedom, rather they free us up a great deal to focus on other things. We are no longer devoting cognitive overhead to figuring out when we need to go to bed if we have a habit of going to sleep at a certain time. We are no longer thinking about how and where to fit in a workout if we already have a habit of working out when we wake up before work. By following habits we free our cognitive selves up to process other things around us.

#### The science of how habits work

There's a 4 step pattern that repeats itself as the backbone of every habit that goes; cue, craving, response, reward.

- Cue - Triggers your brain to initiate a behavior.
- Cravings - The desire for the change that the habit will deliver.
- Response - The actual habit you perform.
- Reward - The end goal of every habit and the result of what performing the response habit entails.

If there's not sufficient behavior in any of the 4 stages it will not become a habit.

These steps are broken into 2 different phases. The first pyhase is the problem phase which encompasses the cue and the craving. This phase is when you realize something needs to change. The second phase is the solution phase which includes the response and reward and is when you take action and achieve the change you're after.

#### The four laws of behavior change

These four laws provide a simple set of rules for creating good habits and breaking bad ones.

How you create a good habit in the 4 step pattern:

1. Cue - Make it obvious.
2. Craving - Make it attractive.
3. Response - Make it easy.
4. Reward - Make it satisfying.

How you break a bad habit in the 4 step pattern:

1. Cue - Make it invisible.
2. Craving - Make it unattractive.
3. Reponse - Make it difficult.
4. Reward - Make it unsatisfying.

### 4 - The Man Who Didn't Look Right

### 6 - Movitation Is Overrated; Environment Often Matters More

#### Anne Thorndike - Primary Care Physician at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston

Created a study at a hospital cafeteria around getting people to drink more water simply by placing water bottles in more locations and more prominent areas. Without saying a word to anyone the soda sales dropped 11.4% while the bottled water increased by 25.8%. The change in environment prompted a change in behavior with no further stimulus.

> Behavior is a function of the Person in their Environment, or B = f(P,E)
> Kurt Lewin - Behavioral Scientists circa 1936

#### How to design your environment for success

Designing your environment for cues to encourage the habits you want will naturally reinforce those habits. Visual cues are one of the most powerful sensory abilities and changing how your environment is arranged will help create the correct cues for desired habits.

##### Examples from page 86

- If you want to remember to take your medication each night, put your pill bottle directly next tot he faucet on the bathroom counter.
- If you want to practice guitar morefrequently, place your guitar stand in the middle of the living room.
- If you want to remember to send more thank you notes, keep a stack of stationary on your desk.
- If you want to drink more water, fill up a few water bottles each morning and place them in common locations around the house.

#### Context is the cue

Triggers are very often not a single cue but many cues that an accumulation of cues that make up a situation (i.e. drinking socially when you hear music, see friends ordering drinks, see tap handles or a backlit liquor shelf).

You can train yourself to link a particular habit with a particular context. If you don't have the ability to get a completely new environment you can redefine or rearrange your current one for the habit you want to create. Avoid mixing contexts between habits. If two habits are associated with a single context, the easier one will usually win out.

> One space, one use.
> James Clear, mantra for creating spaces for habits

### 7 The Secret to Self-Control

Studies have found that people perceived to be very disciplined are actually just better at structuring their environment. The create an environment that doesn't require them to have superhuman self-control because they are not in those tempting sitations often.

> The people with the best self-control are typically the ones who need to use it the least.
> James Clear

Once the grooves of a habit are encoded into our brain it's nearly impossible to remove it entirely. Patty Olwell quit smoking and riding a horse. She went many years without smoking and had little trouble with it until she started riding again when the context and cues of her habit were present once again.

The secret to self-control is making cues for your bad habits impossible to see but making the cues for your good habits obvious.

### 8 How To Make A Habit Irresistible

### 9 The Role of Family and Friends in Shaping Your Habits

Laslo Polgar used his children as a case study of sorts to prove out his idea that innate talent doesn't exist and that in fact, "A genius is not born, but is educated and trained." He homeschooled his children and filled the house with photos os famous chess players and books about chess strategy. The family would always play one another and they would constantly compete in high level tournaments. The children became very successful at chess at a young age and saw their proficiency in chess as completely normal.

Many of our habits are learned or reinforced by the social groups that we are a part of. There are three different groups in particular that we seem to personally imitate for various reasons:

1. The close
2. The many
3. The powerful

#### Imitating The Close

Proximity is a very powerful influencer on our behaviors. We often pickup habits from people close to us like spouses, friends, or other family members just because we're around them all the time. There was a groundbreaking study that found if you were close to someone that became obese your chance of becoming obese as well were 57%. The inverse of this is also true though where if someone in a relationship loses weight the other partner slims down 1/3 of the time as well.

To make desired habits even more attractive you can join a culture where:

1. Your desired behavior is the norm
2. You already have something else in common with the group

Changes your identity from "I am an X" to "We are X together" which is much more powerful.

#### Imitating The Many

Solomon Asch, a psychologist5 in the 1950s, ran an experiment where subjects, surrounded by varying numbers of actors would increasingly agree with an incorrect assessment on the length of 2 lines just because the rest of the subjects (actors unknown to the primary subject) would state the wrong answer. The subject would either doubt themselves due to the number of people giving an answer different from what they knew to be correct or they would give the same answer just to fit in with the rest of the group.

Chimpanzees have been studied and noted that if in part of one group it learns an efficient nut cracking strategy but is then placed into another chimp group with a less efficient nut cracking strategy it will use that strategy to fit in with the new group even though it's less efficient. Conformity is comfortable when surrounded by many that disagree with us. It's often easier to be wrong in the many than right on your own.

#### Imitating The Powerful

Historically, successful people have access to more resources. They have to worry less about survival and that's an enviable status. We imitate the people that we look up to and replicate the things they do to try to achieve that same level of success.

> If a behavior can get us approval, respect, and praise, we find it attractive.

### 10 How to Find and Fix the Causes of Your Bad Habits

While in Turkey, the author had the ability to attend a dinner with his tour guide and some friends. Throughout the course of the evening he found they had all been heavy smokers at one point and half of them had quit. One of them swore by the book called "Allen Carr's Easy Way to Stop Smoking." He summarizes the book as a bunch of statements that make smoking unattractive such as, you're not quitting anything because cigarettes do nothing for you, and you don't need cigarettes to be social. By taking away all of the appealing reasons to smoke he had inverted the 2nd Law of Behavior Change: make it unattractive.

#### Where cravings come from

> "A craving is just a specific manifestation of a deeper underlying motive."

Any habit that we have formed today is trying to fulfill a deeper part of our human nature. We look for approval and connection on social media sites or search for things on the internet to reduce uncertainty in our lives. The habits at root solve the desire that stems from these underlying motives.

Habits are formed by the association of a cue with a prediction of what follows the cue based on our previous experiences. For instance, if we see a hot stove we predict that if we touch it we will burn ourselves so we don't touch it. These predictions lead to feeling, how we might typically describe a craving or an urge.

#### How to reporgram your brain to enjoy habits

Changing our perspective on something can shift the way we feel about it and make that thing more attractive. Changing your view of commitments from "have" to "get" shifts the perspective from obligation to opportunity.

- I have to wake up early for work -> I get to wake up early for work
- I have to cook dinner for my family -> I get to cook dinner for my family

This approach can be applied to shift our perspective on any disciplines that can be seen as difficult to follow if we're able to shift our mindset from a negative perspective to a more positive one, whether it be fitness, frugality, or meditation.

You can use cues you have developed to reinforce positive behavior outside of that original environment. He refers to a boxer and writer who realized his focus and concentration would go up just by the act of putting on his headphones. This was because every time he sat down to write he would put on headphones and play music. Over time the cue of putting on his headphones would give his body and mind the response that it was time to focus, whether he was writing or not.

We can create similar cues in our own lives deliberately. If you want to feel generally more happy, find something that makes you truly happy and create a short routine you do before that thing, like taking 3 deep breaths and smiling. Once that cue has been ingrained in your head you can use it to brighten your spirits whenever needed or make a difficult habit more appealing.

# The 3rd Law - Make It Easy

### 11 Walk Slowly, but Never Backward

A photography professor named Jerry Uelsmann split his class into 2 groups, the first being graded on the quantity of photos they produced and the second being graded by the quality. Interestingly enough, the quatity focused group created the best photos because they put ideas, theories, and tests into practice and figured out how to take good photos. The quality group produced many less photos and since they did not get the repititions to improve their photo taking skills they did not improve.

> "The Best is the enemy of the good." - Voltaire

There is a difference between being in motion and taking action. Being in motion is often preparing for action by reading, studying, organizing, brainstorming, etc. While these motions can have positive effects they produce no output until you actually take action. You can read all about fitness, research programs, study the human body, but until you take action by working out you won't increase your fitness levels.

#### How long does it actually take to form a new habit?

Connections between neurons that are fired as recent patterns of activity are strengthened when these activities are repeated. The brain changes to adapt to the pattern and become more efficient.

> "Neurons that fire together wire together." - Hebb's Law

People often ask how long it will take to form a new habit, but a more accurate way to look at it is how many repititions does it take. On the way to automaticity, or the ability to perform a behavior without thinking about each step, repitions bring you closer to the line not necessarily the length of time.

The most effective way to reach the habit line is to repeat habits you want to form. The best way to do that is to keep in line with the 3rd Law of Behavior Change: make it easy.

### Chapter 12 The Law of Least Effort

The primary axis of Europe and Asia is east to west, while the primary axis of the Americas and Africa is north to south. Since temperature fluctuations are more extreme north to south the continents with a east to west axis experienced an agricultural spread 2 to 3 times faster because the climate was consistent so you could grow the same crops in more spaces. Moving north to south or vice versa leads to significantly different climates and requires different agricultural products and practices which meant relearning how to farm in that region in early years. This is a global instance of the 3rd law of behavior change, the law of least effort.

Any behaviors that take up a lot of space in your life are likely because they are easy and require low levels of motivation. Doom scrolling, watching youtube, checking social media app notifications are all easy habits that require little motivation. Every habit is just an obstacle to get what you want in a sense, dieting and exercise are obstacles to getting in to shape for example. Removing the friction around these obstacles means you will be more likely to succeed in the good habits.

#### How to achieve more with less effort

A water hose with a kink in it can still flow water through but it take much more effort to force the same amount of water through that choke point than just removing the kink in the hose. Removing friction for habits you want to develop is like removing the kink from the hose to let water flow through. It will require much less effort to achieve the same result and therefore make it more likely to be successful in the long run.

One of the most practical ways to do this is to practice environment design. In the 1970s Japan took a manufacturing edge by emphasizing what they called "lean production"; remove waste of all kinds from the production process, including workspaace design. The result was more reliable products produced with less manpower. James refers to this as "addition by subtraction."

#### Prime the environment for future use

An IT developer named Oswald Nuckols is famous for doing this. His cleaning habits were to reset the room as he's done with it. If he's done watching TV, place the remote back on the stand, arrange the pillows, fold the blanket and put it back. By repeating this type of room reset every time he leaves it the room has everything in place the next time he enters it.

James' wife has a stack of cards for various occassions presorted in a box on her desk. She is incredibly good at sending cards appropriately as a result because she has reduced the friction of having to remember to go to the store and find a card when she needs it because it's already on her desk waiting for her. Priming your environment to encourage habits you want is a way of reducing friction.

Environment priming examples:

- If you want to draw more, put the tools on your deak in an easy to reach space.
- If you want to exercise set out your clothes, shoes, bag, and water bottle ahead of time.
- If you want to improve your diet, chop up fruits and vegetables and have them in serving sized continers that are ready to eat.

You can also reverse this approach to discourage bad habits or make them less desirable. For instance, if you watch too much TV and want to cut back you can unplug the TV, remove the batteries from the remote, etc. when you're done watching. Then when you want to watch TV you will have to overcome that friction to do it. If you want to spend less time scrolling on your phone put it in a drawer or another room so you don't get distracted or tempted by it.

### Chapter 13 How to Stop Procrastinating by Using the Two-Minute Rules

One of the greatest dancers and choreographers in the modern era is Twyla Tharp. Much of her success, according to her, is credited to simple daily hbits. For instance, every day she wakes up at 5:30 AM, puts on her workout clothes, walks outside, hails a taxi and tells them to take her to her gym. The ritual isn't the workouts or stretches that she goes through at the gym that morning, it's the cab ride to the gym. That simple act done the same way every day sets her on a path to her routines.

> Decisive Moments - Small moments in your day that deliver an outsized impact on the decisions and actions that follow.

These moments set the options for your future self. Walking into a restaurant is a decisive moment. If you go to a steakhouse you can only order steaks or salads they have on the menu, you cannot order sushi or ramen. The decision to eat at a steak house limited the choices of what you can eat for that meal much like deciding to drive or walk to work, or whether you make dinner or order in food.

#### The two minute rule

Whenever you're starting a new habit it should take no more than 2 minutes to do. Every difficult habit can be distilled down to something that can be accomplished in no more than 2 minutes. For instance, running a marathon is very hard, running a 5k is difficult, walking ten thousand steps isn't easy, walking for ten minutes is easy, and putting on your running shoes only takes a minute.

The goal is to not try to take on too much at once. Find the 2 minute version of your new habit and get consistent at doing that portion of it. After you are consistent with that, use it as a ritual that you can build upon, layer by layer until you achieve the difficult habit. It's not meant to be a "mental trick" or "hack", it's meant to be a starting place to build upon.

##### Examples

1. "Read before bed each night" becomes "Read one page"
2. "Do thirty minutes of yoga" becomes "Take out my yoga mat"
3. "Study for class" becomes "Open my notes"
4. "Fold the laundry" becomes "Fold one pair of socks"
5. "Run three miles" becomes "Tie my running shoes"

> Standardize before you optimize. You can't improve a habit that doesn't exist.

### 14 How to Make Good Habits Inevitable and Bad Habits Impossible

Victor Hugo had agreed to write a new book for his publisher that was due in the summer of 1830. However, instead of working towards that he had been pursuing other projects and focusing on things other than writing. The publisher responded with a new 6 month deadline. His response to prevent himself from procrastinating again was having his assistance lock all of his clothes away except a large shawl. Prevented him from leaving the house and forced him to stay in and focus on his writing. In January of 1832 he released "The Hunchback of Notre Dame".

Success can be just as much about making bad habits hard as it is about making good habits easy. This is a great example of the 3rd Law of Behavior Change to make it difficult.

> Commitment Device - A choice you make in the present that controls your actions in the future. It is a way to lock in future behavior, bind you to good habits, and restrict you from bad ones.

##### Examples

1. Reduce overeating by purchasing food in individual packages instead of in bulk
2. Voluntarily ask to be banned from casinos to prevent future gambling
3. Some athletes will leave their wallets at home when traveling before weigh-in to prevent fast food buying so they can "make weight"

These commitment devices increase the odds that you'll do the right thing in the future by making the bad habits more difficult.

#### How to automate a habit and never thinka bout it again

John Henry Patterson owned a store in a small town that faced a lot of employee theft in the mid 1800s. He bought a device called Ritty's Incorruptible Cashier, the first cash register of the time that automatically locked the receipts and cash between transactions. The employee theft disappeared overnight because the bad behavior was prevented by this machine that automated the transaction process and made stealing much more difficult.

> The best way to break a bad habit is to make it impractical to do. Increase the friction until you don't even have the option to act.

#### Onetime actions that lock in good habits

These actions are things that happen one time but pay off again and again over time. Some of the examples from James' crowd sourced list of one time actions include:

- Get a water filter to clean up your drinking water
- Buy a good mattress and get some blackout curtains to sleep better
- Buy a supportive chair or standing desk to improve your overall health
- Delete games and social media apps on your phone to remove distractions and make you more productive

Technology can also be a way to automate actions that would typically need to be repeated and could be hard, annoying, or complicated to do. This is extra useful in scenarios where the actions are not common enough that you can develop a habit around them. Infrequent actions like prescription refills or saving for retirement can be automated with technology and remove the "need" for these habits almost entirely by leveraging technology.

# The 4th Law - Make It Satisfying

### Chapter 15 The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change

In the 1990s a health worker named Stephen Luby went to Karachi to try to help with the massive amounts of sickness and infection in the poorest areas where people had no running water, lived in dirty and haphazardly put together housing, and were crammed too close together. He discovered that everyone knew hand washing was important but were not putting that knowledge into practice. By providing a soap for free that had a satisfying lather and pleasant smell he was able to have a huge impact on the health of the people living there because hand washing became a pleasant experience and people more consistently performed the action.

> The first three laws of behavior chnage increase the odds a behavior will be performed this time. The fourth law of behavior change - make it satisfying - increases the odds that a behavior will be repeated the next time. It completes the habit loop.

#### The mismatch between immediate and delayed rewards

Immediate-Return Environment - When every decision you make has an immediate impact. Animals on the plains of Africa are thinking about food, sleep, avoiding predators. They're always preoccupied with the immediateness of every decision.

Delayed-Return Environment - When most of the decisions you make may not have an immediate impact but will return on that decision investment down the road. In our modern world this is decision like saving for retirement, eating healthy to be more fit, working hard to get paid in a couple of weeks.

> "It almost always happense that when the immediate consequence is favorable the later consequences are disastrous, and vice versa... Often, the sweeter the first fruit of a habit, the more bitter are its later fruits."
> Frederic Bastiat

Most of the time people want the rewards of long term investment and delayed gratification such as being wealthier, being more fit, having more peace. However, at the decisive moment it is difficult to envision these outcomes because our brains are wired for instant gratification. We can work with our own evolved nature by adding a little bit of immediate gratification to habits we want to encourage and a little bit of pain to habits we want to discourage.

#### How to run instant gratification to your advantage

When you're starting a new habit, or trying to break an old one, it can be difficult to just deprive yourself. For instance, a couple wanted to start cooking together more and eating out less so they started putting $50 into a savings account every time they cooked a meal together instead of going out. At the end of the year they used that savings to go to on their trip together. It can be hard to say no to something you want to do but if you can give yourself a little gratification when you make that right decision you can reinforce the chances that you'll repeat that the next time around.

It's also important to remember that the short term rewards should not be in conflict with your identity. For instance if you're trying to get healthy and your reward for working out is a bowl of ice cream those 2 things are in conflict. Pick something that reinforces your identity of being a healthy person with a massage or something else a healthy person would do that's enjoyable.

> A habit needs to be enjoyable to last!

### Chapter 16 - How to Stick with Good Habits Every Day

In 1993 there was a 23 year old stockbroker in Canada named Trent Dyrsmid.  He used a system of moving 120 paperclips from one jar to another, each one tracking a sales call that he made whether it was successful or not.  This was his system for making sure that he consistently hit a target of making 120 calls a day.  This consistency helped him bring in $5M to the firm.  This strategy created a visual indicator on tracking his sales call habit.  Seeing a paper clip move from one jar to another was visual progress he had made towards his goal.

#### How to keep your habits on track

Habit trackers are easy ways to keep a pulse on if you are succeeding in consistently performing your habits.  You can use notebooks, spreadsheets, calendars, or whatever else to track it, the key is making sure to have something visual that represents the times you were successful in performing that habit.  Habit tracking is another way of making a behavior obvious, attractive, and satsifying.  

##### Benefit #1: Habit tracking is obvious

The visual cues from habit tracking are a visual indicator that can spur you on to repeat a habit.  Research shows that people that track their progress are more likely to improve than those who don't.  Everyone thinks they act better than they actually do, tracking our habits gives us a realistic view of our behavior and when that reality is plainly visible we are less inclined to lie to ourselves.

##### Benefit #2: Habit tracking is attractive

Making progress is motivating!  When we are able to see the consistency of our habits or that we have made progress it continues to pushus to keep the habit alive.  This can be extra useful on the days where it's difficult to motivate ourselves to keep going.

##### Benefit #3: Habit tracking is satisfying

The completion of a habit and the ability to mark it as complete is a dopamine hit.  Seeing our progress continue to grow helps us visualize the success we've built on so far and maintain our focus moving forward.  It's also a form of immediate gratification that helps us feel positive about our momentum.

#### How to recover quickly when your habits break down

It's not possible to always be perfect.  The important thing is that when you lapse or make a mistake that you don't compound it by repeating it.  If you miss a workout don't miss 2 in a row.  If you eat a garbage meal make sure the next one is healthy.  Anyone can have a bad day, make a mistake, or struggle, but winners rebound quickly.  

> "You don't realize how valuable it is to just show up on your bad (or busy) days.  Lost days hurt you more than successful days help you."

It's important to recognize that even if you can't perform a habit completely or at your best level of effort it still matters that you stick to it.  There is an easy pitfall in thinking of habits with an all-or-nothing mentality but even a diminished form of your habits maintains the streak and continues your progress.

#### Knowing when (and when not) to track a habit

Habit tracking is useful when it drives the behaviors that the habit is meant to encourage.  If you're trying to lose weight and the ONLY thing you track is your current weight that could incentivize bad behaviors and practices like crash dieting, juice cleanses, and weight loss pills.  Your brain will  automatically try to "win" at whatever the game is so making sure your tracking the right things for your habits is important to encourage the right behavior.

Measuring things is useful, but only when it creates context and guides your behaviors.  It's a piece of feedback to help us reach our goals, not the goal itself.

### Chapter 17 - How an Accountability Partner Can Change Everything

Roger Fisher proposed putting a nuclear launch code into capsules that would be embedded in chest of a human volunteer that the president would have to kill in order to get the code to fire a nuclear weapon.  The purpose was to force the president to confront death of an innocent person right in front of them to add weight to the decision of firing such a lethal weapon.  Ultimately it was not implemented as there was too much concern that the president would never use the weapons, even if it was necessary.  

Making something immediately painful or difficult as the result of a decision or action is a strong motivator for preventing undesired behaviors.  The more local, tangible, and immediate a punishment is for engaging in a bad habit is the less likely you will be to engage in that behavior.

#### The habit contract

Laws are one of the many contracts that we collectively engage in.  Seat belts were first required by law in 1984 in NY when only 14% of people in The United States wore them, 30 years later that number had climbed to 88%.  There was a huge shift in public habit because you now have to pay a fine if you're caught driving without a seat belt.

Bryan Harris from Nashville, TN implemented a habit contract with his wife and trainer.  If he didn't meet certain fitness goals he would be punished by having to dress up or give his personal trainer $200.  He created this contract to create personal pain anytime he didn't live up to his habits.  

Another version of this could be asking someone to be an accountability partner with us.  Find someone that wants to build the same habit as you and keep each other honest.  There's a social contract to that whereby if you don't live up to your end of the agreement you lose social standing with your friend.  Perhaps they see you as less reliable or trustworthy as a result of you not following through with your agreement.  Thomas Frank has an automated tweet that goes off every morning at 6:10 AM if he doesn't wake up at his 5:55 AM alarm time and says that people can tweet back to claim $5 from him.  Whatever the form of the contract is, find a way to make your less desirable behaviors immediately painful for yourself.
