# Atomic Habits
## An Easy & Proven Way, to Build Good Habits & Break Bad ones
#### by James Clear

### Introduction

James tells the story of how he came about becoming interested in the topic of developing good habits and breaking bad ones.  When he was in 10th grade he was hit in the face with a baseball bat that resulted in a pretty traumatic brain injury.  He was flown to a Cincinnati hospital where they had to medically induce a coma to perform life saving surgery.  

After his recovery he was unable to meet his pre-injury expectations and did not make varsity the next year for baseball.  When he did as a senior he barely plaid 11 innings for the whole season.  In college he was able to make the team as a freshman but would see little to no playing time.  He used this time to start experimenting with habits and creating good patterns of behavior in his life which led him down a very successful path in his college baseball team and beyond.

He began writing after college and went from writing a small news letter to 1000 people to writing a book that's now a #1 New York Times best seller, creating a coaching agency, being quoted by prestigious publications regularly, and professional coaches teaching his approaches to their teams.  His personal investigation into habit building has led him to a successful career and the science and framework of what he's learned is in this book.

### 1 - The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits

British cycling has a pivotal moment in it's history in 2003.  After decades of a losing tradition hired Dave Brailsford as its new performance director which brought a strategy to the team he referred to as "the aggregation of marginal gains".  The primary idea of this strategy is to find a marginal gain in everything you do and the sum of those gains is substantial.  He focused on a 1% gain in everything from redesigned bike seats to the best massage gel to use for muscle recovery to the best pillow and mattress combinations for each rider's ideal sleep.  Main more small changes were made on top of these leading to a massive success in the decade between 2007 and 2017 with 178 world championships, 66 Olympic or Paralympic gold medals, and 5 Tour de France victories.

The anser to this success is the marginal improvements, aggregated, and applied consistently over long timelines.  If you aim for a 1% improvement every day over a year it will yield a 37 fold increase.  Conversely, if you have a 1% decline in you habits every day of the course of a year it will flatline.  Small changes do not seem to matter in the moment but applied consistently over time will have big impacts.

> "Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits."

Using the ice analogy from the book, an ice cube in a cold room may not melt immediately upon raising the temperature of the room by 1 degree.  If the room is at 10 degrees raising it by 1 will make it only 11 degrees which is not warm enough to melt the ice.  Continuing to raise the room a degree at a time will eventually hit 32, then 33 degrees and the ice will start melting. The window between the start of that 1 degree increase and when you actually see the ice to melt, or from a habit perspective when you start to make a small change and then see a recognizable result, is called the Plateau of Latent Potential.

> "Complaining about not achieveing success despite working hard is like complaining about an ice cube not melting when you heated it from twenty-five to thirty-one degrees.  Your work was not wasted it was just being stored.  All the action happens at thirty-two degrees."

Focusing on goals is not a recipe for creating success, focusing on systems is.  While goals are good to have and can indeed help shape the system that may help us reach them, the systems are the driving force behind that change and success we are seeking.  There are 4 major problems to focusing strictly on goals:

1. Winners and losers often will have the same goals.  Every silver medalist presumably had a goal of winning gold.
2. Achieving a goal is only a momentary change.  Once you clean your room if you have not changed your habits you're likely to end up with a messy room again.
3. Goals restrict your happiness.  If you're focused on a future point in time and meeting that goal your happiness is tied up in the future.  Focusing on the system allows you to be happy every day when your system is working.
4. Goals are at odds with long-term progress.  Once the motivation for the goal you were chasing is gone, without a system to perpetuate that behavior the gains are often lost creating a yo-yo effect.

> "You do not rise to the level of your goals.  You fall to the level of your systems."

### 2 - How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa)

There are three types of change, outcome based, process based, and identity based.

1. Oucome - This focuses on achieving results, also known as a specific outcome.  Something like weight loss, salary growth, or running a marathon. What you get.
2. Processes - These are focused on chaning a routine like making a bed, cleaning a desk, updating a workout program.  It's the most common way habits built are associated. What you do.
3. Identity - The focus here is your belief or view of who you are.  Most of your beliefs, assumptions, and biases are associated with this tier.  Who you are.

If you think about these layers of change as a circle where identity is at the core, processes are wrapped around that, and outcomes are the outermost layer you get a picture of how habits are formed.  Most people start with what outcome they want and work their way inward which is a less successful model for habit change because if you don't change your identity, or how you see yourself, you're less likely to follow through with maintaining good habits.  If you start from the center with identity, who you want to become, and base the processes on that new vision of yourself the outcomes will come from those changes as a result of your new vision of yourself.

Exmaples of shifting from an outcome focus to an identity focus:
- The goal is not to read a book, the goal is to become a reader. 
- The goal is not to to run a marathon, the goal is to become a runner.
- The goal is not to learn an instrument, the goal is to become a musician.

These identities can also be negative impacts on our lives.  For instance:
- I'm terrible with directions
- I'm not a morning person (ouch)
- I'm bad at remembering people's names (double ouch)

When you accept these as norms for your identity you fall into these behavioral patterns.  It becomes self-fulfilling.

#### The Two-Step process to changing your identity

1. Decide the type of person you want to be.
2. Prove it to yourself with small wins.

Each action that validates the identity you have for yourself is like casting a vote for that identity.  That identity doesn't have to win unanimously, everyone will make mistakes, but if you're voting for that identity a majority of the time with your actions or habits then you see success.  Each time you write a page, you are a writer.

#### The real reason habits matter

> "Are you becoming the type of person you want to become?"

The first step is not the what or the how, but who.  Starting with who you want to be is the north start for all habit building and decisions.  As you build habits and achieve these wins with actions that line up with your identity you start to prove it to be true and become the person you want to be.

### 3 - How To Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps

> "behaviors followed by satisfying consequences tend to be repeated and those that produce unpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated."
> Edward Thorndike

#### Why your brain builds habits

Habits are pre-programmed actions that your brain defaults to when a particular problem arises.  When we are solving a problem, we are actively engaged in the act of thinking through possible solutions and paths forward.  As we continue to solve that problem over and over again our brain hands over the response to those problems to our subconscious to free up cognitive load to focus on whatever is most pressing.

> "Habits are, simply, reliable solutions to recurring problems in our environment."
> Jason Hreha

Habits do not restrict freedom, rather they free us up a great deal to focus on other things.  We are no longer devoting cognitive overhead to figuring out when we need to go to bed if we have a habit of going to sleep at a certain time.  We are no longer thinking about how and where to fit in a workout if we already have a habit of working out when we wake up before work.  By following habits we free our cognitive selves up to process other things around us.

#### The science of how habits work

There's a 4 step pattern that repeats itself as the backbone of every habit that goes; cue, craving, response, reward.

- Cue - Triggers your brain to initiate a behavior.
- Cravings - The desire for the change that the habit will deliver.
- Response - The actual habit you perform.
- Reward - The end goal of every habit and the result of what performing the response habit entails.

If there's not sufficient behavior in any of the 4 stages it will not become a habit.

These steps are broken into 2 different phases.  The first pyhase is the problem phase which encompasses the cue and the craving.  This phase is when you realize something needs to change.  The second phase is the solution phase which includes the response and reward and is when you take action and achieve the change you're after.

#### The four laws of behavior change

These four laws provide a simple set of rules for creating good habits and breaking bad ones.

How you create a good habit in the 4 step pattern:
1. Cue - Make it obvious.
2. Craving - Make it attractive.
3. Response - Make it easy.
4. Reward - Make it satisfying.

How you break a bad habit in the 4 step pattern:
1. Cue - Make it invisible.
2. Craving - Make it unattractive.
3. Reponse - Make it difficult.
4. Reward - Make it unsatisfying.

### 6 - Movitation Is Overrated; Environment Often Matters More

#### Anne Thorndike - Primary Care Physician at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston
Created a study at a hospital cafeteria around getting people to drink more water simply by placing water bottles in more locations and more prominent areas.  Without saying a word  to anyone the soda sales dropped 11.4% while the bottled water increased by 25.8%.  The change in environment prompted a change in behavior with no further stimulus.

> Behavior is a function of the Person in their Environment, or B = f(P,E)
> Kurt Lewin - Behavioral Scientists circa 1936

#### How to design your environment for success
Designing your environment for cues to encourage the habits you want will naturally reinforce those habits.  Visual cues are one of the most powerful sensory abilities and changing how your environment is arranged will help create the correct cues for desired habits.

##### Examples from page 86
- If you want to remember to take your medication each night, put your pill bottle directly next tot he faucet on the bathroom counter.
- If you want to practice guitar morefrequently, place your guitar stand in the middle of the living room.
- If you want to remember to send more thank you notes, keep a stack of stationary on your desk.
- If you want to drink more water, fill up a few water bottles each morning and place them in common locations around the house.

#### Context is the cue
Triggers are very often not a single cue but many cues that an accumulation of cues that make up a situation (i.e. drinking socially when you hear music, see friends ordering drinks, see tap handles or a backlit liquor shelf).

You can train yourself to link a particular habit with a particular context.  If you don't have the ability to get a completely new environment you can redefine or rearrange your current one for the habit you want to create.  Avoid mixing contexts between habits.  If two habits are associated with a single context, the easier one will usually win out.

> One space, one use. 
> James Clear, mantra for creating spaces for habits

### 7 The Secret to Self-Control
Studies have found that people perceived to be very disciplined are actually just better at structuring their environment.  The create an environment that doesn't require them to have superhuman self-control because they are not in those tempting sitations often.

> The people with the best self-control are typically the ones who need to use it the least.
> James Clear

Once the grooves of a habit are encoded into our brain it's nearly impossible to remove it entirely.  Patty Olwell quit smoking and riding a horse.  She went many years without smoking and had little trouble with it until she started riding again when the context and cues of her habit were present once again.

The secret to self-control is making cues for your bad habits impossible to see but making the cues for your good habits obvious.

### 8 How To Make A Habit Irresistible

### 9 The Role of Family and Friends in Shaping Your Habits

Laslo Polgar used his children as a case study of sorts to prove out his idea that innate talent doesn't exist and that in fact, "A genius is not born, but is educated and trained."  He homeschooled his children and filled the house with photos os famous chess players and books about chess strategy.  The family would always play one another and they would constantly compete in high level tournaments.  The children became very successful at chess at a young age and saw their proficiency in chess as completely normal.

Many of our habits are learned or reinforced by the social groups that we are a part of.  There are three different groups in particular that we seem to personally imitate for various reasons:

1. The close
2. The many
3. The powerful

#### Imitating The Close
Proximity is a very powerful influencer on our behaviors.  We often pickup habits from people close to us like spouses, friends, or other family members just because we're around them all the time.  There was a groundbreaking study that found if you were close to someone that became obese your chance of becoming obese as well were 57%.  The inverse of this is also true though where if someone in a relationship loses weight the other partner slims down 1/3 of the time as well.

To make desired habits even more attractive you can join a culture where:
1. Your desired behavior is the norm
2. You already have something else in common with the group

Changes your identity from "I am an X" to "We are X together" which is much more powerful.

#### Imitating The Many
Solomon Asch, a psychologist5 in the 1950s, ran an experiment where subjects, surrounded by varying numbers of actors would increasingly agree with an incorrect assessment on the length of 2 lines just because the rest of the subjects (actors unknown to the primary subject) would state the wrong answer.  The subject would either doubt themselves due to the number of people giving an answer different from what they knew to be correct or they would give the same answer just to fit in with the rest of the group.

Chimpanzees have been studied and noted that if in part of one group it learns an efficient nut cracking strategy but is then placed into another chimp group with a less efficient nut cracking strategy it will use that strategy to fit in with the new group even though it's less efficient.  Conformity is comfortable when surrounded by many that disagree with us.  It's often easier to be wrong in the many than right on your own.

#### Imitating The Powerful
Historically, successful people have access to more resources.  They have to worry less about survival and that's an enviable status.  We imitate the people that we look up to and replicate the things they do to try to achieve that same level of success.  

> If a behavior can get us approval, respect, and praise, we find it attractive.

### 10 How to Find and Fix the Causes of Your Bad Habits

While in Turkey, the author had the ability to attend a dinner with his tour guide and some friends.  Throughout the course of the evening he found they had all been heavy smokers at one point and half of them had quit. One of them swore by the book called "Allen Carr's Easy Way to Stop Smoking."  He summarizes the book as a bunch of statements that make smoking unattractive such as, you're not quitting anything because cigarettes do nothing for you, and you don't need cigarettes to be social.  By taking away all of the appealing reasons to smoke he had inverted the 2nd Law of Behavior Change: make it unattractive.

#### Where cravings come from

> "A craving is just a specific manifestation of a deeper underlying motive."

Any habit that we have formed today is trying to fulfill a deeper part of our human nature.  We look for approval and connection on social media sites or search for things on the internet to reduce uncertainty in our lives.  The habits at root solve the desire that stems from these underlying motives.

Habits are formed by the association of a cue with a prediction of what follows the cue based on our previous experiences.  For instance, if we see a hot stove we predict that if we touch it we will burn ourselves so we don't touch it.  These predictions lead to feeling, how we might typically describe a craving or an urge.  

#### How to reporgram your brain to enjoy habits

Changing our perspective on something can shift the way we feel about it and make that thing more attractive.  Changing your view of commitments from "have" to "get" shifts the perspective from obligation to opportunity.  

- I have to wake up early for work -> I get to wake up early for work
- I have to cook dinner for my family -> I get to cook dinner for my family

This approach can be applied to shift our perspective on any disciplines that can be seen as difficult to follow if we're able to shift our mindset from a negative perspective to a more positive one, whether it be fitness, frugality, or meditation.

You can use cues you have developed to reinforce positive behavior outside of that original environment.  He refers to a boxer and writer who realized his focus and concentration would go up just by the act of putting on his headphones.  This was because every time he sat down to write he would put on headphones and play music.  Over time the cue of putting on his headphones would give his body and mind the response that it was time to focus, whether he was writing or not.  

We can create similar cues in our own lives deliberately. If you want to feel generally more happy, find something that makes you truly happy and create a short routine you do before that thing, like taking 3 deep breaths and smiling.  Once that cue has been ingrained in your head you can use it to brighten your spirits whenever needed or make a difficult habit more appealing.

# The 3rd Law - Make It Easy

### 11 Walk Slowly, but Never Backward

A photography professor named Jerry Uelsmann split his class into 2 groups, the first being graded on the quantity of photos they produced and the second being graded by the quality.  Interestingly enough, the quatity focused group created the best photos because they put ideas, theories, and tests into practice and figured out how to take good photos.  The quality group produced many less photos and since they did not get the repititions to improve their photo taking skills they did not improve.

> "The Best is the enemy of the good." - Voltaire

There is a difference between being in motion and taking action.  Being in motion is often preparing for action by reading, studying, organizing, brainstorming, etc.  While these motions can have positive effects they produce no output until you actually take action.  You can read all about fitness, research programs, study the human body, but until you take action by working out you won't increase your fitness levels.

#### How long does it actually take to form a new habit?

Connections between neurons that are fired as recent patterns of activity are strengthened when these activities are repeated.  The brain changes to adapt to the pattern and become more efficient.

> "Neurons that fire together wire together." - Hebb's Law

People often ask how long it will take to form a new habit, but a more accurate way to look at it is how many repititions does it take.  On the way to automaticity, or the ability to perform a behavior without thinking about each step, repitions bring you closer to the line not necessarily the length of time.  

The most effective way to reach the habit line is to repeat habits you want to form.  The best way to do that is to keep in line with the 3rd Law of Behavior Change: make it easy.

### Chapter 12 The Law of Least Effort

The primary axis of Europe and Asia is east to west, while the primary axis of the Americas and Africa is north to south.  Since temperature fluctuations are more extreme north to south the continents with a east to west axis experienced an agricultural spread 2 to 3 times faster because the climate was consistent so you could  grow the same crops in more spaces.  Moving north to south or vice versa leads to significantly different climates and requires different agricultural products and practices which meant relearning how to farm in that region in early years.  This is a global instance of the 3rd law of behavior change, the law of least effort.

Any behaviors that take up a lot of space in your life are likely because they are easy and require low levels of motivation.  Doom scrolling, watching youtube, checking social media app notifications are all easy habits that require little motivation.  Every habit is just an obstacle to get what you want in a sense, dieting and exercise are obstacles to getting in to shape for example.  Removing the friction around these obstacles means you will be more likely to succeed in the good habits.

#### How to achieve more with less effort

A water hose with a kink in it can still flow water through but it take much more effort to force the same amount of water through that choke point than just removing the kink in the hose.  Removing friction for habits you want to develop is like removing the kink from the hose to let water flow through.  It will require much less effort to achieve the same result and therefore make it more likely to be successful in the long run.  

One of the most practical ways to do this is to practice environment design. In the 1970s Japan took a manufacturing edge by emphasizing what they called "lean production"; remove waste of all kinds from the production process, including workspaace design.  The result was more reliable products produced with less manpower.  James refers to this as "addition by subtraction."

#### Prime the environment for future use

An IT developer named Oswald Nuckols is famous for doing this.  His cleaning habits were to reset the room as he's done with it.  If he's done watching TV, place the remote back on the stand, arrange the pillows, fold the blanket and put it back.   By repeating this type of room reset every time he leaves it the room has everything in place the next time he enters it.  

James' wife has a stack of cards for various occassions presorted in a box on her desk.  She is incredibly good at sending cards appropriately as a result because she has reduced the friction of having to remember to go to the store and find a card when she needs it because it's already on her desk waiting for her. Priming your environment to encourage habits you want is a way of reducing friction.

Environment priming examples:
- If you want to draw more, put the tools on your deak in an easy to reach space.
- If you want to exercise set out your clothes, shoes, bag, and water bottle ahead of time.
- If you want to improve your diet, chop up fruits and vegetables and have them in serving sized continers that are ready to eat.

You can also reverse this approach to discourage bad habits or make them less desirable.  For instance, if you watch too much TV and want to cut back you can unplug the TV, remove the batteries from the remote, etc. when you're done watching.  Then when you want to watch TV you will have to overcome that friction to do it.  If you want to spend less time scrolling on your phone put it in a drawer or another room so you don't get distracted or tempted by it.
