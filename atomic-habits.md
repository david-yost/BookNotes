# Atomic Habits
## An Easy & Proven Way, to Build Good Habits & Break Bad ones
#### by James Clear

### Introduction

James tells the story of how he came about becoming interested in the topic of developing good habits and breaking bad ones.  When he was in 10th grade he was hit in the face with a baseball bat that resulted in a pretty traumatic brain injury.  He was flown to a Cincinnati hospital where they had to medically induce a coma to perform life saving surgery.  

After his recovery he was unable to meet his pre-injury expectations and did not make varsity the next year for baseball.  When he did as a senior he barely plaid 11 innings for the whole season.  In college he was able to make the team as a freshman but would see little to no playing time.  He used this time to start experimenting with habits and creating good patterns of behavior in his life which led him down a very successful path in his college baseball team and beyond.

He began writing after college and went from writing a small news letter to 1000 people to writing a book that's now a #1 New York Times best seller, creating a coaching agency, being quoted by prestigious publications regularly, and professional coaches teaching his approaches to their teams.  His personal investigation into habit building has led him to a successful career and the science and framework of what he's learned is in this book.

### 1 - The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits

British cycling has a pivotal moment in it's history in 2003.  After decades of a losing tradition hired Dave Brailsford as its new performance director which brought a strategy to the team he referred to as "the aggregation of marginal gains".  The primary idea of this strategy is to find a marginal gain in everything you do and the sum of those gains is substantial.  He focused on a 1% gain in everything from redesigned bike seats to the best massage gel to use for muscle recovery to the best pillow and mattress combinations for each rider's ideal sleep.  Main more small changes were made on top of these leading to a massive success in the decade between 2007 and 2017 with 178 world championships, 66 Olympic or Paralympic gold medals, and 5 Tour de France victories.

The anser to this success is the marginal improvements, aggregated, and applied consistently over long timelines.  If you aim for a 1% improvement every day over a year it will yield a 37 fold increase.  Conversely, if you have a 1% decline in you habits every day of the course of a year it will flatline.  Small changes do not seem to matter in the moment but applied consistently over time will have big impacts.

> "Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits."

Using the ice analogy from the book, an ice cube in a cold room may not melt immediately upon raising the temperature of the room by 1 degree.  If the room is at 10 degrees raising it by 1 will make it only 11 degrees which is not warm enough to melt the ice.  Continuing to raise the room a degree at a time will eventually hit 32, then 33 degrees and the ice will start melting. The window between the start of that 1 degree increase and when you actually see the ice to melt, or from a habit perspective when you start to make a small change and then see a recognizable result, is called the Plateau of Latent Potential.

> "Complaining about not achieveing success despite working hard is like complaining about an ice cube not melting when you heated it from twenty-five to thirty-one degrees.  Your work was not wasted it was just being stored.  All the action happens at thirty-two degrees."

Focusing on goals is not a recipe for creating success, focusing on systems is.  While goals are good to have and can indeed help shape the system that may help us reach them, the systems are the driving force behind that change and success we are seeking.  There are 4 major problems to focusing strictly on goals:

1. Winners and losers often will have the same goals.  Every silver medalist presumably had a goal of winning gold.
2. Achieving a goal is only a momentary change.  Once you clean your room if you have not changed your habits you're likely to end up with a messy room again.
3. Goals restrict your happiness.  If you're focused on a future point in time and meeting that goal your happiness is tied up in the future.  Focusing on the system allows you to be happy every day when your system is working.
4. Goals are at odds with long-term progress.  Once the motivation for the goal you were chasing is gone, without a system to perpetuate that behavior the gains are often lost creating a yo-yo effect.

> "You do not rise to the level of your goals.  You fall to the level of your systems."

### 2 - How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa)

There are three types of change, outcome based, process based, and identity based.

1. Oucome - This focuses on achieving results, also known as a specific outcome.  Something like weight loss, salary growth, or running a marathon. What you get.
2. Processes - These are focused on chaning a routine like making a bed, cleaning a desk, updating a workout program.  It's the most common way habits built are associated. What you do.
3. Identity - The focus here is your belief or view of who you are.  Most of your beliefs, assumptions, and biases are associated with this tier.  Who you are.

If you think about these layers of change as a circle where identity is at the core, processes are wrapped around that, and outcomes are the outermost layer you get a picture of how habits are formed.  Most people start with what outcome they want and work their way inward which is a less successful model for habit change because if you don't change your identity, or how you see yourself, you're less likely to follow through with maintaining good habits.  If you start from the center with identity, who you want to become, and base the processes on that new vision of yourself the outcomes will come from those changes as a result of your new vision of yourself.

Exmaples of shifting from an outcome focus to an identity focus:
- The goal is not to read a book, the goal is to become a reader. 
- The goal is not to to run a marathon, the goal is to become a runner.
- The goal is not to learn an instrument, the goal is to become a musician.

These identities can also be negative impacts on our lives.  For instance:
- I'm terrible with directions
- I'm not a morning person (ouch)
- I'm bad at remembering people's names (double ouch)

When you accept these as norms for your identity you fall into these behavioral patterns.  It becomes self-fulfilling.

#### The Two-Step process to changing your identity

1. Decide the type of person you want to be.
2. Prove it to yourself with small wins.

Each action that validates the identity you have for yourself is like casting a vote for that identity.  That identity doesn't have to win unanimously, everyone will make mistakes, but if you're voting for that identity a majority of the time with your actions or habits then you see success.  Each time you write a page, you are a writer.

#### The real reason habits matter

> "Are you becoming the type of person you want to become?"

The first step is not the what or the how, but who.  Starting with who you want to be is the north start for all habit building and decisions.  As you build habits and achieve these wins with actions that line up with your identity you start to prove it to be true and become the person you want to be.

> "behaviors followed by satisfying consequences tend to be repeated and those that produce unpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated."
> Edward Thorndike

#### Why your brain builds habits

Habits are pre-programmed actions that your brain defaults to when a particular problem arises.  When we are solving a problem, we are actively engaged in the act of thinking through possible solutions and paths forward.  As we continue to solve that problem over and over again our brain hands over the response to those problems to our subconscious to free up cognitive load to focus on whatever is most pressing.

> "Habits are, simply, reliable solutions to recurring problems in our environment."
> Jason Hreha

Habits do not restrict freedom, rather they free us up a great deal to focus on other things.  We are no longer devoting cognitive overhead to figuring out when we need to go to bed if we have a habit of going to sleep at a certain time.  We are no longer thinking about how and where to fit in a workout if we already have a habit of working out when we wake up before work.  By following habits we free our cognitive selves up to process other things around us.

#### The science of how habits work

There's a 4 step pattern that repeats itself as the backbone of every habit that goes; cue, craving, response, reward.

- Cue - Triggers your brain to initiate a behavior.
- Cravings - The desire for the change that the habit will deliver.
- Response - The actual habit you perform.
- Reward - The end goal of every habit and the result of what performing the response habit entails.

If there's not sufficient behavior in any of the 4 stages it will not become a habit.

These steps are broken into 2 different phases.  The first pyhase is the problem phase which encompasses the cue and the craving.  This phase is when you realize something needs to change.  The second phase is the solution phase which includes the response and reward and is when you take action and achieve the change you're after.

#### The four laws of behavior change

These four laws provide a simple set of rules for creating good habits and breaking bad ones.

How you create a good habit in the 4 step pattern:
1. Cue - Make it obvious.
2. Craving - Make it attractive.
3. Response - Make it easy.
4. Reward - Make it satisfying.

How you break a bad habit in the 4 step pattern:
1. Cue - Make it invisible.
2. Craving - Make it unattractive.
3. Reponse - Make it difficult.
4. Reward - Make it unsatisfying.

### 6 - Movitation Is Overrated; Environment Often Matters More

#### Anne Thorndike - Primary Care Physician at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston
Created a study at a hospital cafeteria around getting people to drink more water simply by placing water bottles in more locations and more prominent areas.  Without saying a word  to anyone the soda sales dropped 11.4% while the bottled water increased by 25.8%.  The change in environment prompted a change in behavior with no further stimulus.

> Behavior is a function of the Person in their Environment, or B = f(P,E)
> Kurt Lewin - Behavioral Scientists circa 1936

#### How to design your environment for success
Designing your environment for cues to encourage the habits you want will naturally reinforce those habits.  Visual cues are one of the most powerful sensory abilities and changing how your environment is arranged will help create the correct cues for desired habits.

##### Examples from page 86
- If you want to remember to take your medication each night, put your pill bottle directly next tot he faucet on the bathroom counter.
- If you want to practice guitar morefrequently, place your guitar stand in the middle of the living room.
- If you want to remember to send more thank you notes, keep a stack of stationary on your desk.
- If you want to drink more water, fill up a few water bottles each morning and place them in common locations around the house.

#### Context is the cue
Triggers are very often not a single cue but many cues that an accumulation of cues that make up a situation (i.e. drinking socially when you hear music, see friends ordering drinks, see tap handles or a backlit liquor shelf).

You can train yourself to link a particular habit with a particular context.  If you don't have the ability to get a completely new environment you can redefine or rearrange your current one for the habit you want to create.  Avoid mixing contexts between habits.  If two habits are associated with a single context, the easier one will usually win out.

> James Clear, mantra for creating spaces for habits

### 7 The Secret to Self-Control
Studies have found that people perceived to be very disciplined are actually just better at structuring their environment.  The create an environment that doesn't require them to have superhuman self-control because they are not in those tempting sitations often.

> The people with the best self-control are typically the ones who need to use it the least.
> James Clear

Once the grooves of a habit are encoded into our brain it's nearly impossible to remove it entirely.  Patty Olwell quit smoking and riding a horse.  She went many years without smoking and had little trouble with it until she started riding again when the context and cues of her habit were present once again.

The secret to self-control is making cues for your bad habits impossible to see but making the cues for your good habits obvious.
