# Good To Great
#### by Jim Collins

## Chapter 1 - Good Is The Enemy Of Great
- The reason so many things fail to become great is because quite good is comfortable
- A dollar invested in the good-to-great companies in 1965 should multiply 471 times by 1/1/2000 where the rest of the market would see a 56 fold increase
- This book is a result of 5 years of research with a team of 21 individuals
- They started by identifying the companies that made the transition from good to great using financial analysis where they were at or below the general stock market punctuated by a transition point then cumulative returns at least three times the market over the next fifteen years
- The companies selected had to exemplify this patter, any companies in an industry that showed the same pattern hollistically were dropped
- It is possible to turn good into great in the most unlikely of situations
- After narrowing down the good-to-great companies they created a list of "comparison companies" to try to identify the differences between the two groups
- Direct comparison companies were used to match resources and availability prior to the transition point
- Unsustained comparison companies were selected that made a momentary shift from good to great but failed to maintain that trajectory
- They used articles published, executive interviews, aquisitions, executive compensations, business strategy, culture, layoffs, leadership style, financial ratios and management turnover to analyze all 28 companies in the study

## Chapter 2 - Level 5 Leadership

> You can accomplish anything in life, provided that you do not mind who gets the credit. 
> **-Harry S. Truman**

> I never stopped trying to become qualified for the job. 
> **-Darwin Smith**

- Level 5 leaders channel their ego needs away from themselves and into the larger goal of building a great company.  It's not that Level 5 leaders have no ego or self-interest.  Indeed, they are incredibly ambitious - but their ambition is first and foremost for the institution, not themselves.
- In over 3/4 of the comparison companies, executives setup their successors for failure, chose weak successors or did both.
- Comparison companies had very I-centric leaders, good-to-great companies had leaders that didn't talk about themselves.
- In more than 2/3 of the comparison companies there was a gargantuan personal ego that contributed to the demise or continued mediocrity of the company.
- Level 5 leadership isn't just humility and modesty, it's equally about ferocious resolve to do whatever the company needs to become great.
- Going for a high-profile outside change agent is negatively correlated with sustained transformation from good to great.
- Level 5 leaders look out the window to apportion credit to factors outside themselves when things go well (and if they cannot find a specific person or event to give credit to, they credit good luck).  At the same time, they look in the mirror to apportion responsibility never blaming bad luck when things go poorly.


## Chapter 3 - First Who... Then What
- If you begin with "who", rather than "what", you can more easily adapt to a changing world.
- If you have the right people on the bus, the problem of how to motivate and manage people largely goes away.
- If you have the wrong people, it doesn't matter whether you discover the right direction; you still won't have a great company.
- "That's how you build the future.  If I'm not smart enought o see the changes that are coming, they will.  And they'll be flexible enough to deal with them." - Dick Cooley
- The "genius with a thousand helpers" model uses the company as a platform for the talents of one extraordinary individual, the companies success is tied to this one person's genius. 
- There was no systematic executive compensation that lead a company from good to great based on the study cases.
- In a good-to-great transformation, people are not your most important asset.  The right people are.

> The only way to deliver to the people who are achieving is to not burden them with the people who are not achieving.
> **-unknown Wells Fargo executive**

> ### How to be rigorous and not ruthless
> 1. When in doubt, don't hire - keep looking.
> 2. When you know you need to make a people change, act.
>	- How do you know when you have the wrong person on the bus, not just in the wrong seat?
>		- If it was a haring decision, would you hire this person again?
>		- If the person told you they were leaving would you be disappointed or relieved? 
> 3. Put your best people on your biggest opportunities, not your biggest problems.

- You need executives, on the one hand, who argue and debate-sometimes violently-in pursuit of the best answers, yet, on the other hand, who unify fully behind a decision, regardless of parochial interests.

## Chapter 4 - Confront The Brutal Facts (Yet Never Lose Faith)
> There is no worse mistake in public leadership than to hold out false hopes soon to be swept away.
> **-Winston S. Churchill, The Hinge of Fate**

- Kroger outperformed A&P after 1973 (the transition point) by over 80 times in the years to come because they confronted the brutal facts and adjusted their approach to match the new realities of what consumers wanted  from a grocery store.

### Facts are better than dreams
- Breakthrough results come about bya  series of good decisions, diligently executed and accumulated one on top of another.
- The good-to-great companies displayed two distinctive forms of disciplined thought.
    - The first is that they infused the entire process with the brutal facts of reality.
    - The second is that they developed a simple, yet deeply insightful, frame of reference for all decisions.
- There's nothing wrong with pursuing a vision for greatness.  But, unlike comparison companies, the good-to-great companies continually refined the path to greatness with the brutal facts of reality.

> When yo uturn over rocks and look at all the squiggly things underneath, yo ucan eithe rput the rock down, or you can say, 'My job is to turn over rocks and look at the squiggly things,' even if what you see can scare the hell out of you.
> Fred Purdue, Pitney Bowes Executive

- Charisma can be as much of a liability as an asset.  Strength of personality can sow the seeds of problems when people filter the brutal facts from you.

### A climate where the truth is heard
- One of the single most de-motivating actions you can take is to hold out false hopes, soon to be swept away by events.
- Leadership is equally about creating a climate where the truth is heard and the brutal facts confronted.
- The 4 best practices to make sure the truth is heard:
    1. Lead with questions, not answers
    2. Engage in dialogue and debate, not coercion
    3. Conduct autopsies, without blame
    4. Build "red flag" mechanisms

### Unwaivering faith amid the brutal facts
