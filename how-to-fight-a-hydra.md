# How To Fight A Hydra

## Face Your Fears, Pursue Your Ambitions, and Become The Hero You Are Destined To Be

#### by Josh Kaufman

# Part 1 - The Quest
- There are many reasons to not embark on a quest whether self imposed or otherwise
- Don't let others decide your fate, decide for yourself and understand your journey
- Prepare for the journey, new endeavors require new skills, build those skills
- Acknowledge the difficulty of what's ahead of you and prepare physically and mentally to face it

# Part 2 - The Journey
- When tackling something new you will possibly spend a fair amount of time wandering to find the right path
- It's important to keep your skills sharp along the journey
- When you are the master of your own destiny there's no one to tell you what to do so it's important to be clear eyed about your goal
- While you're on your journey you mind run into other dangers that threated your ability to complete the journey

# Part 3 - The Struggle
- Finding the hydra you want to slay doesn't mean that you have to do it immediately
- Exploring different paths and perspectives is good information gathering to build out a plan of attack
- Take time to examine your previous interactions and what you can learn from them to be better next time
- You don't have to kill a hydra in one encounter, you can outlast it and take it down bit by bit
- Don't be afraid to take calculated risks with different plans of attack to see if they are valuable
- The first win can be a boost of courage to build on that success for the next steps
- Sometimes your progress will be slowed by a mistake, it's OK to make mistakes but you must be patient and learn from them
- It takes diligent and persistent planning, effort, adjusting, and execution to slay a hydra

# Part 4 - The Outcome
- The hydra was not in fact guarding some great wealth of treasure, the hydra was the treasure
- Completing the quest meant pulling value from the vanquished hydra, the win itself was not the end, he must gather the rewards
- Returning home from the quest is a rewarding environment with people proud of him and telling tales of victory
- While enjoying the benefits of a quest completed, soon the restlessness to set out on another quest sets in

# Part 5 - The Insight
- Logging lessons learned from adventures is a great way to maintain wisdom that can easily be lost to the passage of time
- Hydras exist in deep dark caverns that require exploring to discover and planning and experimentation to defeat
- Keeping your tools familiar and in strong working order is key to success on your adventures
- Fighting hydras never gets easier, but it does get more familiar, don't let the unease of facing down big things dissuade you from trying at all
- Often times our fear of the unknown is worse than reality, take action, reassess, and experiment

> There's a middle path between humility and hubris: work to find it.

- The reward is not guaranteed just because you take the risk, but fortune does tend to favor those who act and a lack of action guarantees no reward
- No one adventures forever, don't be afraid to bring adventuring to an end when the time is right

# Part 6 - The Decision
- With the reputation of successfully slaying hydras other adventurers may seek you out to aid them in other quests
- Carefully consider these quests, is there risk worth taking here or is it not an advantageous situation for your skills
- Even with the promise of riches and renown there may be good cause to turn down this new adventure
- Every adventurer must decide if the quest before them is worth the risk and if they are prepared to take on that risk
