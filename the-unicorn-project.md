### Chapter 1 - Wednesday, September 3

Maxine, a strong IT professional, comes back from family vacation to find that a major failure with the payroll software has resulted in multiple people being canned and herself being reassigned. Her boss Chris reassures her that she will be back in 4 months if she keeps her head down and doesn't make any waves while she's on her new assignemnt, The Phoenix Project. Maxine feels exiled to a project that is overbudget, behind schedule, and by all accounts ready to be scrapped.

After gathering her things and reporting to her new building she finds that the new buidling she's working in is drab and the floors are endless cubicle mazes that seem lifeless and impersonal. Meeting her new boss, Randy, and one of her new teammates, Josh, are the 2 bright spots in moving to this new project as they both seem sincere and engaged in what's going on, even though their conversations are already giving her an idea of what a mess the project is.

She gets her standard developer setup and upon logging into her new laptop finds that she has access to some HR tools and the Office Suite. All necessary tools but not what a developer needs to be productive. After hours of searching she can't find the source code repo, documentation for how any of their projects build, or access any of the crucial servers for her to be capable of doing any part of her job. Instead of having a good start on a documentation buildout plan she has a mile long list of todos consisting of getting access to the right servers, platforms, and repos.

#### Takeaways

- The book didn't really dive into how the blame was placed on Maxine but it definitely gives the impression that it was unjust. Chris may have saved Maxine from the axe but by placing blame for the failure on her, because she was conveniently on vacation, was bing a terrible leader. It is important to stand up for your people, especially when they're being unjustly maligned and don't deserve it.
- Top performers like Maxine are difficult to come by. She went from thinking she worked for a great company to updating her resume because her boss hung her out to dry. Don't underestimate the impact your actions as a leader have on the people on your team.
- Documentation is important! Maxine burned hours of her day just compiling a list of questions because her machine was not setup correctly and there was nowhere for her to get answers. Providing knowledge bases with a repeatable path to success for anything reduces ramp up time and provides new teammates with a consistent experience and confidence in their new team.
- When people are afraid to share problems it's often indicative of a bad corporate culture. Simple mistakes being punished instead of getting used as learning opportunities only encourages behavior that hides missteps and prevents people from innovating because of that fear.
