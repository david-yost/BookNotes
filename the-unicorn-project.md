# The Unicorn Project

## A Novel about Developers, Digital Disruption, and Thriving in the Age of Data

#### by Gene Kim

## Part One: September 3 - September 18

### Chapter 1 - Wednesday, September 3

#### Summary 

Maxine, a strong IT professional, comes back from family vacation to find that a major failure with the payroll software has resulted in multiple people being canned and herself being reassigned. Her boss Chris reassures her that she will be back in 4 months if she keeps her head down and doesn't make any waves while she's on her new assignemnt, The Phoenix Project. Maxine feels exiled to a project that is overbudget, behind schedule, and by all accounts ready to be scrapped.

After gathering her things and reporting to her new building she finds that the new buidling she's working in is drab and the floors are endless cubicle mazes that seem lifeless and impersonal. Meeting her new boss, Randy, and one of her new teammates, Josh, are the 2 bright spots in moving to this new project as they both seem sincere and engaged in what's going on, even though their conversations are already giving her an idea of what a mess the project is.

She gets her standard developer setup and upon logging into her new laptop finds that she has access to some HR tools and the Office Suite. All necessary tools but not what a developer needs to be productive. After hours of searching she can't find the source code repo, documentation for how any of their projects build, or access any of the crucial servers for her to be capable of doing any part of her job. Instead of having a good start on a documentation buildout plan she has a mile long list of todos consisting of getting access to the right servers, platforms, and repos.

#### Takeaways

- The book didn't really dive into how the blame was placed on Maxine but it definitely gives the impression that it was unjust. Chris may have saved Maxine from the axe but by placing blame for the failure on her, because she was conveniently on vacation, was bing a terrible leader. It is important to stand up for your people, especially when they're being unjustly maligned and don't deserve it.
- Top performers like Maxine are difficult to come by. She went from thinking she worked for a great company to updating her resume because her boss hung her out to dry. Don't underestimate the impact your actions as a leader have on the people on your team.
- Documentation is important! Maxine burned hours of her day just compiling a list of questions because her machine was not setup correctly and there was nowhere for her to get answers. Providing knowledge bases with a repeatable path to success for anything reduces ramp up time and provides new teammates with a consistent experience and confidence in their new team.
- When people are afraid to share problems it's often indicative of a bad corporate culture. Simple mistakes being punished instead of getting used as learning opportunities only encourages behavior that hides missteps and prevents people from innovating because of that fear.

### Chapter 2 - Friday, September 5th

#### Summary 

After a couple of days compiling to-do lists and getting fewer answers than new questions, Maxine has made very little progress in her quest to have a buildable version of the Phoenix project on her machine.  She only has one of many repos download, is still missing credentials for valuable share drives that are somehow being managed on separate Active Directories by separate managers, can’t find the config files she needs, and is still wading through copious amounts of documentation that often yield very little in the way of helpful direction.  On top of all of these frustrations, as she’s getting ready to leave on Friday, Randy catches her and asks her to fill out her timesheets for budgetary reasons.  She’s given an opaque project code to log everything against and does her best to cobble some notes together about how she’s been spending her time the last few days in a way that feels less than honest at Randy’s direction.

The following Monday marks the big company wide town hall update that gives all employees at the organization a bit of visibility from the C-suite about what’s going on in the company, how revenue projections are going, what the stock is doing and how they’re responding to it, and any leadership changes that are happening along with how they will affect the organization.  This time she learns that the current CEO, Steve Masters, is being supplanted as the Chairman of the board and being replaced by the former CEO Bob Strauss, although Steve will maintain the CEO role.  Bob goes on to explain that the company is in a time of war, and splitting the roles of Chairman and CEO are necessary in times like these to ensure the company is responding appropriately to fierce competition and shrinking market share.  Later on in the presentation the SVP of retail operations, announces that the Phoenix project will be launching later this month which is met with concerned murmurs across the auditorium.

At the end of the town hall there is a small time for Q&A which allows employees to get answers for specifics they might not have received during the updates from leadership.  Most of it is background noise for Maxine until she hears someone ask about the embarrassing payroll glitch that was laid at her feet and the reason she was moved to the Phoenix Project.  This jolts her wandering mind back to reality to relive the frustration of being unceremoniously migrated to this stagnant corporate prison to serve her time for a mistake that wasn’t hers.  

#### Takeaways

-  Is there value in a daily work diary?  Maxine keeps a daily diary of the projects she’s worked on, including how time might have been wasted, triumphs she’s had in problem solving, and lessons learned from barking up the wrong tree from time to time.  Having a personal repository to reference like this could be useful?
-  Engineers like solving problems, it’s fun, that’s why we do it.  Give engineers the right problems to solve by removing the ones that are not fun or necessary from their to-do list of problems to solve.
-  As a leader, we must learn to be consistent with our messaging.  Sarah Moulton, the SVP of retail operations, changed her messaging at town halls regularly without explanation.  Her erratic positions in her presentations lead to a lot of confusion and eventually ridicule because no one could take her seriously.
-  Remember who your “customers” are.  When we think of a customer in the abstract instead of real people we often do not achieve the desired outcome.
-  Sarah Moulton announces the launch of the Phoenix Project at the end of the month.  Based on the response it sounds like that’s not a date based in reality.  As a leader we need to make sure we have a realistic picture of the work that needs to be done and make sure we don’t commit our teams to deadlines that are not driven by facts.
