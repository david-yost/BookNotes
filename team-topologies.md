## Part 1: Teams As The Means Of Delivery

### Chapter 1: The Problem With Org Charts

> "Organizations should be viewed as complex and adaptive organisms rather than mechanistic and linear systems." -Naomi Stanford, Guide to Organisation Design

- We should stop looking at teams as collections of interchangeable individuals that will succeed as long as the use the "right" processes and "right" tools.  Instead we should treat people and technology as a single human/computer sociotechnical ecosystem.
- Communication lines are often different than reporting lines of an org chart.
- Systems thinking focuses on optimizing the whole, looking at the overall flow of work, identifying what the largest bottleneck is todasy, and eliminating it.  Then repeat.
- Similar to how architecture diagrams are usually stale soon after work starts, org charts are usually out of sync with reality.

**Three different organizational structures**
1. Formal structure (the org chart) - facilitates compliance
2. Informal structure - the "realm of influence" between individuals
3. Value creation structure - how work gets done based on inter-personal and inter-team reputation

- Team topologies abandons the historically static organizational structure in favor of an adaptable model that suits the current situation.

**Team Topologies provides four fundamental team types**
1. Stream-aligned
2. Platform
3. Enabling
4. Complicated-subsystem

**Team Topologies provides 3 core team interaction modes**
1. Collaboration
2. X-as-a-service
3. Facilitating

> "Organizations which design systems...are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communications structures of these organizations." -Conway's Law

- When a team's cognitive load isn't considered, typically the team ends up spread thin, being tasked with excessive responsibilities and domain ownership.  This leads to a lack of mastery and lengthened context switching timelines.
- Too many team responsibilities also is antithetical to Dan Pink's three elements of intrinsic motivation: autonomy (juggling too many requests and priorities for other people), mastery (being a "jack of all trades, master of none"), and purpose (too many domains of responsibility).
