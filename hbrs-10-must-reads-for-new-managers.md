## Becoming the Boss
#### by Linda A. Hill

- The struggles that face new managers are the norm, not the exception.

### Why Learnign To Manage Is So Hard

- Becoming a manager is by definition a stretch assignment.
- Skills required for managing are significantly different from whatever makes you successful in your previous role.
- Focus shifts from individual skills and execution to setting and implementing an agenda for a whole group.
- Most star individual performers haven't made many mistakes, however, the trial-and-error of learning to lead can be uncomfortable for someone who usually knows what to do to be successful.

#### Myths and Realities

1. Myth

### A New Manager's Misconceptions

- There are misconceptions and myths that often lead new managers to neglect certain key leadership responsibilities.

1. Defining characteristic of the new role
    a. Myth: Authority - Now I will have the freedom to implement my ideas.
    b. Reality: Interdepencency - It's humbling that someone who works for me could get me fired.
2. Source of power
    a. Myth: Formal authority - I will finally be on top of the ladder.
    b. Reality: Everything but - Folks were wary, and you really had to earn it.
3. Desired outcome
    a. Myth: Control - I must get compliance from my subordinates.
    b. Reality: Commitment - Compliance does not equal commitment.
4. Managerial Focus
    a. Myth: Managing one-on-one - My role is to build relationships with individual subordinates.
    b. Reality: Leading the team - I need to create a culture that will allow the group to fulfill it's potential.
5. Key challenge
    a. Myth: Keeping the operation in working order - My job is to make sure the operation runs smoothly.
    b. Reality: Making changes that will make the team perform better - I am responsible for initiating changes to enhance the group's performance.

### Managers wield significant authority

- New managers tend to focus on the supposed rights and priviledges that come along with being a boss.
- These new positions are perceived to come with new authority and autonomy to allow them to "get things done" but in reality these new rights and priviledges are limited by interdependencies of relationships with peers, bosses and external parteners.

> "Until they give up the myth of authority for the reality of negotiating interdependencies, new managers will not be able to lead effectively."
> **Linda A. Hill**

### Authority flows from the manager's position

- Management gives you "formal authority" but the real power in motivating your team is in establishing credibility.
- Demonstrating character, especially to people reporting to you, is the biggest step forward in earning the credibility to effectively manage a team.
- Demonstrating competence is important to prove your technical knowledge and prowess as well, although less tactically important than demonstrating character.
    - Trying to hands on manage too directly in order to demonstrate technical competence can sometimes undermine your credibility as a manager.
- Demonstrating influence and the ability to delivery and execute the right thing.  People hate working for a "powerless boss".

### Managers must not control their direct reports

- The tendency for new managers feeling insecure in their new role is to desire compliance from their subordinates, worrying that if it's not established they will be taken advantage of.
- Compliance is not equal to commitment.  If you want to be able to delegate to problem solvers you need them committed to the cause, not compliant to your demands.
- Creating a "Culture of Inquiry" allows you to share power with direct reports and gain commitment and influence in return.  Ask questions and questions to follow up those questions until direction and vision is clear, then continue to ask questions about the direction those original questions sent you in.

### Manager must focus on forging good individual relationships

- Team management is not equal to the managing of the individuals on the team.
- You need to pay attention to the team culture and performance.
- One-on-one relationships are important for being a manager but managing a team through individual relationships will not produce a better team.

### Managers must ensure that things run smoothly

- New managers need to realize that they're responsible for recommending and initiating change that can improve their group's performance.
- Improvements for a group's performance can be outside of the manager's formal authority. 
- Ineffective managers see their groups failures through the lense of a faulty system or process rather than looking for ways to improve it or remove the impedements.

## Leading the Team You Inherit
#### by Michael D. Watkins

- Figuring out how to work with an existing team, especially one with problematic personnel or relationships, is like trying to repair a plane engine mid flight.  You can't completely shut down the engine without causing a crash but you need to figure out a way to fix things while moving forward.

- A common framework for build a team is "storming, forming, norming, and performing" created by Bruce Tuckman in 1965.  This guide, however, is focused on building a team from scratch and assuming and transforming an existing team.  

- The following sections describe that framework with these 3 steps
1. Asses the team
2. Reshape the team
3. Accelerate the team's development

### Assessing the Team

#### Sample questions to efficiently assess the team
- Are the right people doing the right things in the right ways?
- What qualities should teammembers have in order to tackle the challenges facing the team?
- How important and divers or complimentary skills on the team?
- What parts are shapeaple through your personal leadership?

> People in critical positions will be assessed with greater urgency and higher standards.

- Can the people in essential positions to meet goals carry out the work in front of them?
- Will the team need to collaborate much or can they work in isolation?  (i.e. how much should I focus on developing team work?)

#### Team evaluation tool
- Take each topic below, give it a percentage of emphasis out of 100.  The total of all topics should add up to 100.  Also, note that each one of these topics could be rated for different roles on the team.

1. Competence - Has the technical expertise and experience to do the job effectively.
2. Trustworthiness - Can be relied up on to be straight with you and to follow through on commitments.
3. Energy - Brings the right attitude to the job.
4. People skills - Gets along well with others on the team and supports collaboration.
5. Focus - Sets priorities and sticks to them, instead of veering off in all directions.
6. Judgement - Exercises good sense, especially under pressure or when faced with making sacrifices for the greater good.

#### Steps for early 1 on 1s
1. Prepare - Review any personnel history, performance data, skill sets, relationships, etc.
2. Create an interview template - Gather a list of the same questions that you want to ask each person on the team.
    a. What are the weaknesses of our existing strategy?
    b. What are our biggest challenges and opportunities in the short term? Mid term?
    c. What resources could we leverage more effectively?
    d. How could we improve the way the team works together?
    e. If you were in my position what would your priorities be?
3. Look for verbal and nonverbal clues - Do they offer up information or do you have to extract it?  Do their words match their body language? 
4. Summarize and share what you learn - Share your findings with the team in a meeting, address areas where disagreement exists, see how the team operates under a modest amount of stress.

### Reshaping the Team

- Promote high performance behaviors by focusing on these 4 factors:
    1. Composition - Finding the best way to get the right people into the right positions for success.
        - Replacing people within the first few months should be reserved for dire situations where people in critical roles cannot do the work or when people are truly toxic and undermine the business.
        - Waiting for turnover allows you to reshape composition.  This can take time but can be accelerated by indicating the level of performative expectation you have on the team.
        - Finding open positions elsewhere in the organization that better suits someone that is valuable but potentially not a good fit for the current team.
        - Invest in high potential individuals to take on new responsibilities and increase the scope of their existing role.
    2. Alignment with a Shared Vision - In order to accomplish this, the team must agree on answers to four simple questions.
        - What will we acomplish? (mission, goals, and metrics)
        - Why should we do it? (vision statement and incentives)
        - How will we do it? (strategy in relation to the organization's, plans and activities for execution)
        - Who will do what? (team member's roles and responsibilities must support the answers to the above 3 questions)
    3. Operating Model
        - Rethink how and when people come together to do the work.
        - Don't feel the need to continue operating the way your predecessor did "just becase".
        - Figure out your team's reall constraints, such as business planning or budget processes, and identify ways to operate more efficiently within them.
        - Find out which activities require more frequent attention and develop meeting cadences accordingly to support them.
    4. Integration of New Rules and Expectations
        - Establish ground rules and processes to feed and sustain desired behaviors
        - Serve as a role model for the team

#### Operational vs Strategic vs Learning meetings
- Strategic meetings are less frequent and tend to be focused on making big decisions.  They focus on big topics such as business models, vision, strategy and organizational configurations and as such, require lengthier durations to discuss these topics.  Operation meetings are focused on short term performance and how to adjust plans and/or acivities according to that performance.  These meetings should be more frequent and shorter that strategic meetings.  Learning meetings are in response to things such as crises or oncoming issues and are only used on an as needed basis.  Do not try to do all of these in a single recurring meeting, the operational urgencies tend to crowd out everything else.

- Be up front with each decision, will you make the call, use a small group for counsel, or seek full-tem consensus.

### Accelerate the Team's Development

- Help energize the team with some early wins to reinforce the value of the new rules and processes.
- Creating the successes and buidling on them creates a virtuous cycle of achievement and confidence.
