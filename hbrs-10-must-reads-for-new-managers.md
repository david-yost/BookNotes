## Becoming the Boss
#### by Linda A. Hill

- The struggles that face new managers are the norm, not the exception.

### Why Learnign To Manage Is So Hard

- Becoming a manager is by definition a stretch assignment.
- Skills required for managing are significantly different from whatever makes you successful in your previous role.
- Focus shifts from individual skills and execution to setting and implementing an agenda for a whole group.
- Most star individual performers haven't made many mistakes, however, the trial-and-error of learning to lead can be uncomfortable for someone who usually knows what to do to be successful.

#### Myths and Realities

1. Myth

### A New Manager's Misconceptions

- There are misconceptions and myths that often lead new managers to neglect certain key leadership responsibilities.

1. Defining characteristic of the new role
    a. Myth: Authority - Now I will have the freedom to implement my ideas.
    b. Reality: Interdepencency - It's humbling that someone who works for me could get me fired.
2. Source of power
    a. Myth: Formal authority - I will finally be on top of the ladder.
    b. Reality: Everything but - Folks were wary, and you really had to earn it.
3. Desired outcome
    a. Myth: Control - I must get compliance from my subordinates.
    b. Reality: Commitment - Compliance does not equal commitment.
4. Managerial Focus
    a. Myth: Managing one-on-one - My role is to build relationships with individual subordinates.
    b. Reality: Leading the team - I need to create a culture that will allow the group to fulfill it's potential.
5. Key challenge
    a. Myth: Keeping the operation in working order - My job is to make sure the operation runs smoothly.
    b. Reality: Making changes that will make the team perform better - I am responsible for initiating changes to enhance the group's performance.

### Managers wield significant authority

- New managers tend to focus on the supposed rights and priviledges that come along with being a boss.
- These new positions are perceived to come with new authority and autonomy to allow them to "get things done" but in reality these new rights and priviledges are limited by interdependencies of relationships with peers, bosses and external parteners.

> "Until they give up the myth of authority for the reality of negotiating interdependencies, new managers will not be able to lead effectively."
> **Linda A. Hill**

### Authority flows from the manager's position

- Management gives you "formal authority" but the real power in motivating your team is in establishing credibility.
- Demonstrating character, especially to people reporting to you, is the biggest step forward in earning the credibility to effectively manage a team.
- Demonstrating competence is important to prove your technical knowledge and prowess as well, although less tactically important than demonstrating character.
    - Trying to hands on manage too directly in order to demonstrate technical competence can sometimes undermine your credibility as a manager.
- Demonstrating influence and the ability to delivery and execute the right thing.  People hate working for a "powerless boss".

### Managers must not control their direct reports

- The tendency for new managers feeling insecure in their new role is to desire compliance from their subordinates, worrying that if it's not established they will be taken advantage of.
- Compliance is not equal to commitment.  If you want to be able to delegate to problem solvers you need them committed to the cause, not compliant to your demands.
- Creating a "Culture of Inquiry" allows you to share power with direct reports and gain commitment and influence in return.  Ask questions and questions to follow up those questions until direction and vision is clear, then continue to ask questions about the direction those original questions sent you in.

### Manager must focus on forging good individual relationships

- Team management is not equal to the managing of the individuals on the team.
- You need to pay attention to the team culture and performance.
- One-on-one relationships are important for being a manager but managing a team through individual relationships will not produce a better team.

### Managers must ensure that things run smoothly

- New managers need to realize that they're responsible for recommending and initiating change that can improve their group's performance.
- Improvements for a group's performance can be outside of the manager's formal authority. 
- Ineffective managers see their groups failures through the lense of a faulty system or process rather than looking for ways to improve it or remove the impedements.
