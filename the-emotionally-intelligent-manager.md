## Part 2 : Understand Your Emotional Skills

### Chapter 3 - Read People, Identifying Emotions

- Being able to identify and understand emotions in yourself and those around you is the important first step in being emotionally intelligent.
- In the example of Bob, being able to read emotions that others might ignore allowed him to tune into client sentiments that were often missed, helping to saving relationships and succeed with his brash and blue collar affect in an otherwise poshed and upper-crust environment.

> Recognizing the difference between a stranger who is friendly and ready to help you and a stranger who is unfriendly and ready to attack you can spell the difference between living another day and ending up dead.

Skills for identifying emotions
1. Accurately identify how you and others feel
2. Sensing emotion in art and music
3. Expressing emotions
4. Reading between the lines
5. Detect real vs fake emotions

- Being able to accurately express your emotions, and not hide or suppress them, means that people will be able to respond more accurately to how you're feeling.
- Perceiving the emotion of someone in a situation accurately allows us to approach the situation with finesse.
- The ability to spot fake emotion versus emotions that are actually being felt is important to make sure you are accurately interpreting the situation.
- All of these components are data points that can be useful in navigating a situation's emotions.

### Chapter 4 - Get in the Mood, Using Emotions

- It is important to have access to the full range of emotions, from positive to negative, in order to fully understand and process a situation accurately.
- Being closed off to emotion is often reflected by a rigid thinking style.  
- Processing emotions accurately to evaluate a situation can lead to creative thinking and breakthrough ideas as illustrated by Julia's story.
- Not everything linking to emotion and though is emotional intelligence, it requires using these emotions to enhance and assist our thought process meaningfully.
- Nervousness and worry can be used intelligently to help you scan for threats and problem solve.
- Understanding another person's point of view can be relatively easy, but it's much harder to see and experience the world from their perspective.
- Thinking often shifts with out moods and if we are able to harness those moods we are more likely to engage in creative thinking.

> "Leadership, which embraces the emotional side of directing organizations, pumps life and meaning into management structures, bringing them to full life" - Barach, J. A., and Eckhardt, D. R. Leadership and the Job of the Executive

- Thinking does not happen without emotion, and emotion actually speeds up the decision making process tremendously.
- Alice Isen found that giving a small gift to medical students resulted with quicker and more accurate diagnosis because happy and positive emotions make us more likely to feel generous and think creatively.
- Mood-congruent memory (a.k.a. affect-dependent recall) is the phenomenon of remembering information better when in the same mood as when information was acquired.
- It is important to be aware of the various connections between emotions and cognitive processes and attempt to match emotions, whenever possible, to the work ahead or to select work for someone based on how they are feeling.

### Chapter  5 - Predict the Emotional Future, Understanding Emotions

- Problems can often stem from a misdiagnosis of the cause of people's feelings and therefore what trajectory their feelings would take as a result, as illustrated by Suzzane's story.
- Acknowledging difficult situations, or news, and having a desire to treat people honestly and fairly means being transparent in difficult times while still giving credit where you can as shown in Len's story.
- Understanding emotions takes the most though and a great deal of knowledge about what causes emotions and how they transition from one stage to another.
- Conveying emotions accurately requires us to have a rich emotional vocabulary and use it effectively.
- A common emotional equation is "if event X then emotion Y". 
- Some emotions can consist of combinations of other more simple emotions, sometimes even emotions that seem at odds with each other.
- Emotions are not static and will often develop and change as they progress.
- What-if planning can be critically important when evaluating people's emotions and how they might react to a situation, and correctly predicting the future can help us respond more adeptly.
