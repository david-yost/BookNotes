#### by David R. Caruso and Peter Salovey

## Part 1 : Learn About the World of Emotional Intelligence

### Chapter 1 - Emotions And Reasoning At Work

TODO: fill out the rest of chapter 1 notes

##### Principle 6: Emotional universals exist, but so do specifics

- Secondary emotions, or self-conscious emotions, usually have strong social or cultural components to them.
- Gender can have effects on emotions and emotional intelligence, and women have a slight advantage in the hard skills of emotional intelligence.
- Gender can also affect how actions are perceived, the same behavior could be seen as positive or negative between depending on the gender of the person taking the action.

### Chapter 2 - An Emotional Blueprint

#### Emotional Blueprint

- A schematic diagram that was created to better help us understand the emotions of a situation and to give you explicit steps to process them.
- There are 4 related skills for emotional intelligence:
    1. Read people - identify emotions: Identifying how you and those around you feel and your ability to express those feelings.
    2. Get in the mood - use emotion: Use your emotions in harmony with your thinking, use them to change your perspective.
    3. Predict the emotional future - understand emotions: Understand the emotions so you can determine what you will do.
    4. Do it with feeling - Manage emotions: Be open to your emotions and use the information to make informed decisions.
- Steps for the emotional blueprint:
    1. Identify emotions - get complete and accurate data by listening, asking questions, and paraphrasing to ensure you understand how your team feels.
    2. Use emotions - Have feelings help guide your thinking by determining how those feelings influence your thinking and the thinking of the team.
    3. Understand emotions - Evaluate possible emotional scenarios by examining the causes of these feelings and what may happen next.
    4. Manage emotions - Determine underlying, root cause and take action to solve the problem by including the rational, logical information available with the emotional data you just gathered to make an optimal decision.
- You must be willing to open yourself to strong feelings, both positive and negative.

## Part 2 : Understand Your Emotional Skills

### Chapter 3 - Read People, Identifying Emotions

- Being able to identify and understand emotions in yourself and those around you is the important first step in being emotionally intelligent.
- In the example of Bob, being able to read emotions that others might ignore allowed him to tune into client sentiments that were often missed, helping to saving relationships and succeed with his brash and blue collar affect in an otherwise posh and upper-crust environment.

> Recognizing the difference between a stranger who is friendly and ready to help you and a stranger who is unfriendly and ready to attack you can spell the difference between living another day and ending up dead.

Skills for identifying emotions
1. Accurately identify how you and others feel
2. Sensing emotion in art and music
3. Expressing emotions
4. Reading between the lines
5. Detect real vs fake emotions

- Being able to accurately express your emotions, and not hide or suppress them, means that people will be able to respond more accurately to how you're feeling.
- Perceiving the emotion of someone in a situation accurately allows us to approach the situation with finesse.
- The ability to spot fake emotion versus emotions that are actually being felt is important to make sure you are accurately interpreting the situation.
- All of these components are data points that can be useful in navigating a situation's emotions.

### Chapter 4 - Get in the Mood, Using Emotions

- It is important to have access to the full range of emotions, from positive to negative, in order to fully understand and process a situation accurately.
- Being closed off to emotion is often reflected by a rigid thinking style.  
- Processing emotions accurately to evaluate a situation can lead to creative thinking and breakthrough ideas as illustrated by Julia's story.
- Not everything linking to emotion and though is emotional intelligence, it requires using these emotions to enhance and assist our thought process meaningfully.
- Nervousness and worry can be used intelligently to help you scan for threats and problem solve.
- Understanding another person's point of view can be relatively easy, but it's much harder to see and experience the world from their perspective.
- Thinking often shifts with out moods and if we are able to harness those moods we are more likely to engage in creative thinking.

> "Leadership, which embraces the emotional side of directing organizations, pumps life and meaning into management structures, bringing them to full life" - Barach, J. A., and Eckhardt, D. R. Leadership and the Job of the Executive

- Thinking does not happen without emotion, and emotion actually speeds up the decision making process tremendously.
- Alice Isen found that giving a small gift to medical students resulted with quicker and more accurate diagnosis because happy and positive emotions make us more likely to feel generous and think creatively.
- Mood-congruent memory (a.k.a. affect-dependent recall) is the phenomenon of remembering information better when in the same mood as when information was acquired.
- It is important to be aware of the various connections between emotions and cognitive processes and attempt to match emotions, whenever possible, to the work ahead or to select work for someone based on how they are feeling.

### Chapter  5 - Predict the Emotional Future, Understanding Emotions

- Problems can often stem from a misdiagnosis of the cause of people's feelings and therefore what trajectory their feelings would take as a result, as illustrated by Suzzane's story.
- Acknowledging difficult situations, or news, and having a desire to treat people honestly and fairly means being transparent in difficult times while still giving credit where you can as shown in Len's story.
- Understanding emotions takes the most though and a great deal of knowledge about what causes emotions and how they transition from one stage to another.
- Conveying emotions accurately requires us to have a rich emotional vocabulary and use it effectively.
- A common emotional equation is "if event X then emotion Y". 
- Some emotions can consist of combinations of other more simple emotions, sometimes even emotions that seem at odds with each other.
- Emotions are not static and will often develop and change as they progress.
- What-if planning can be critically important when evaluating people's emotions and how they might react to a situation, and correctly predicting the future can help us respond more adeptly.

### Chapter 6 - Do It with Feeling, Managing Emotions

- Managing emotions means being able to use your feelings, and the feelings of others, as part of your thinking process.
- Managing emotions does not mean that you never feel emotions and that your actions are never emotional, but rather that it's integrated into your decisions in a way that improves your life and those around you.
- There was an experiment that showed people watching an upsetting film remembered less about the film if they tries to suppress their emotions.
- Some instances can make sense to suppress emotions, especially if we're not sure how to process what we're feeling in the moment.
- Other time we need to allow ourself to feel things because to suppress them means spending mental energy on that and not problem solving using what your feeling to inform your thought process.
- It's important to not allow the impulses of our emotions control our actions as a result, being impulsive with our reactions to overwhelming emotions can be just as damaging as ignoring them all together.
- Managing our emotions is important because it means our conduct is guided both by thoughts and feelings, allowing us to make the most informed decision in any given set of circumstances.
- We should neither suppress nor vent emotions, but should rather reflect on them and use them to make intelligent decisions inspired by additional information we gain from them.

### Chapter 7 - Measuring Emotional Skills

- To measure how emotionally intelligent you are you can take a "MSCEIT" (pronounced mess-keet) to evaluate your current skillset.
- Evaluating how someone is feeling means paying attention to the details of their demeanor and expression (e.g. smiling with their eyes means that the smile is more likely genuine and not forced).
- Matching tasks to the mood we're currently experiences can be valuable (e.g. proofing a budget when you're feeling sad because it helps us be more detailed and look for problems).
- Checking our emotional vocabulary can help us determine if our ability to predict our emotional future (e.g. sorrow is usually experienced because of a loss which starts with frustration at that loss and turns to acceptance as we come to terms with it).
- Thinking through responding to an emotionally charged situation can help us see how strong we are at managing emotions (e.g. a coworker that lied on their resume shares their secret with you and you help them process those emotions).
- The MSCEIT has been developed using answers from thousands of people that have been analyzed and refined to create a normalized dataset that's used a base for comparison.

## Part 3 : Develop You Emotional Skills

### Chapter 8 - Read People Correctly, Improving Your Ability to Identify Emotions

- A mood journal or emotional diary can be a useful tool in tracking patterns in our emotional life to better understand our own emotions.
- Watching yourself mimic emotions in a mirror, recording yourself in faux interviews or introductions, and playing emotional charades can all be great tools for practicing using the emotions you want when you speak.
- Emotional clues are conveyed by others in 3 ways including; (1) facial expressions, (2) the pitch, rhythm, and tone of their voice, and (3) posture and body language.
- The mouth, eyes, and nose all have discrete facial movements that can often give you a good indicator of how someone is feeling.
- Catching emotional lies requires paying attention to emotional queues that don't match the emotion they're trying to portray, the bigger the stakes of the lie the strong the competing emotions.
- Using language such as "You seem" can but a useful way to confirm how others are feeling to see if you're observing their emotions accurately.

### Chapter 9 - Get in the Right Mood, Improving Your Ability to Use Emotions

- People have natural emotional dispositions that can impair their thinking rather than enhancing it.  It's not just a question of *when* to use emotions to enhance our thinking it's a question of *which* emotions can enhance our thinking.
- Happy emotions make our creative thinking stronger, helps us think outside the box, allows us to see things at a more visionary scale, but can also lead to more problem solving errors.
- The emotion of fear, at least in small doses, can help us re-evaluate old assumptions.  Everything and everyone is suspect and must be reviewed!
- Sadness can be useful if it becomes instructive when the heightened sense of sadness helps us consider overlooked problems or determine the cause of a previous failure.
- The use of anger can be destructive but it does narrow or field of vision and focuses on a target that is our perceived threat.  This can be useful when needed to defend intellectual property, stand up for those who are unable to stand up for themselves, or correct an injustice (an actual in justice, not just a perceived one).
- Surprise can be a shock to our complacent attitude and kicks us into information seeking mode.  Our attention is broadened and we're looking for any new information that we perviously weren't privy to.
- The tools of method acting can be useful in generating a mood that you wish to deploy in order to better suit the task you have at hand.
- Developing the use of your emotional imagination can help you learn to feel what others feel, it's important to counteract negative emotions with positive emotions before concluding the exercise though.
- Repeating short positive statements to yourself can be a great tool for quickly increasing your positive emotions.
- Negative emotions, like sadness, are sometimes necessary because we need support or comfort.  Other times they can prevent us from moving forward and remembering our own, or other's, stories of triumph and resilience can help us shift our emotional energy.

### Chapter 10 - Predict the Emotional Future Accurately, Improving Your Ability to Understand Emotions

- James Russellk developed an emotional system that focuses them in a range around a circle with pleasantness and energy level being their x and y axis respectively.
- The basic emotions consist of anger, happiness, fear, surprise, and sadness.
    1. Anger - Arises out of a sense of wrong or injustice, but sometimes that can be misinterpreted.  It can be wielded both intelligently and unintelligently, but also has health risks associated with it.
    2. Happiness - This is a feeling that we have done something good that we value.
    3. Fear - It is often directed toward the future, that something bad is going to happen that we're not yet seeing clearly.  When fear is persistent and generalized you have anxiety.
    4. Surprise - When something happens that we do no anticipate or when plans are not going to work because the unexpected occurred.
    5. Sadness - Experiencing disappointment or loss will often result in sadness, or when something we care about is taken from us.
- Social emotions are social or culture-bound and include disgust, shame and guilt, and embarassment.
    1. Disgust - This social emotion is meant to help keep others in line, to not cross boundaries of what social boundaries must be kept.
    2. Shame and Guilt - Both of these are indications that we did not live up to some standard of importance to us, but shame is more focused on the failed act while guilt is more focused on the personal failing.
    3. Embarassment - Outwardly, this is a sign of acknowledgement, and almost a physical apology that we messed up and can sometimes serve to stave off a fight because that outward appears shows that you know you made a mistake and makes you look less threatening.
- It's necessary to get outside of your own head to discern how other people's experiences might impact their thinking.
- Understanding emotional progressions is key to being able to understand someone else's emotional story and how they may be thinking and more importantly, predict how they _will_ feel.

### Chapter 11 - Do It with Smart Feelings, Improving Your Ability to Manage Emotions

- You cannot resolve emotional distress with quick fix solutions like food, drink, daydreaming, or watching TV because they are temporary and when returning from them the origins of the distress are still there and sometimes worse.
- One way you can effectively manage emotional distress is to write or journal about something for twenty minutes straight without thinking about it or editing.
- Another way to help you emotionally regulate is to exercise regularly, at least 20 - 30 minutes 3 times a week.
- Looking at how we have changed from one emotional extreme to the next can help us reverse engineer how we were able to navigate that change so we can do it deliberately if necessary.
- Moods are the background noise of diffuse feelings we have and the way we interpret events is often heavily influenced by the mood that we are in.
- Dispositional traits are a person's typical mood which filters the way they look at the events in the world around them.
- Disengaging from emotion means we are aware of and process only the nonemotional data in a couple of ways.
    1. Avoidance of Emotions - Turning away from and avoiding events that could be emotional in some capacity. 
    2. Denial of Emotions - After experiencing an emotional even, actively hiding or preventing any sort of reaction to the emotional event.
- Engagement of emotion can be done at various levels and through different strategies.
    1. Emotional Reappraisal - Change the way you view a subjective emotional experience by recasting it in a way that's more acceptable for the environment.
    2. Emotional Acknowledgement - You recognize the emotion to do not attempt to address or solve it and move on.
    3. Emotional Integration - If we are generally aware of emotion in ourselves and others we can integrate emotion and thought but our strategy will most likely be basic.  At it's best it will include the four steps of the Emotional Blueprint.
- Anger can be a useful tool for recognizing and addressing injustice but can also be incredibly destructive if not properly managed.

## Part 4 : Applying Your Emotional Skills

### Chapter 12 - Managing You, Applying Your Emotinoal Intelligence Skills

> Perspective taking assumes that you can see the world through the eyes of another, and it can lead to some pretty interesting, yet uncomfortable, realizations.

- The story of Yuki the investor illustrates how important it is to be aware of your emotional proclivities and when it might make sense to try to adjust them manually.  
    - She knew that with her typical positive emotions she would not be as critical of the Seattle CEO's proposal.  
    - Being in tune with how positive she felt, Yuki took deliberate steps to bring her emotions down to find critical misses in the plan so she could request assurances on how to fix them.
    - Ultimately, she leveraged the emotional blueprint to navigate this situation by being accutely aware of her own emotions.
- The story of Russell the compliance guy is a similar but almost mirror image of Yuki, highlighting his neutral to negative disposition which made him good at finding mistakes or inconsistencies in deals.
    - In a new role Russell took on that negative posture made him less likeable amongst his clients and partners.
    - Russell had to learn to bring his default neutral to negative demeanor more positive and did so by leveraging fond memories of fly fishing with his father whenever he needed to.
    - This allowed him to be more positive and think creatively and feel what others felt.
- The story of Marcy the CPA shows how emotional intelligence was successfully applied in some areas but not in others.
    - Marcy found a financial mistake and provided the CFO with a recommended course of action, when he wanted her to cover up the mistake rather than fix it she refused because of her values and was ultimately fired.
    - Using her emotional intelligence skills she was able to see how uneasy her HR rep was at the start of their conversation and put herself in his shoes and considered the CFO's perspective.  
    - Marcy was able to identify why the HR rep was acting nervous and understand why the CFO might see her as a threat or "loose cannon" from his perspective.
    - While she was able to use her EQ skills to navigate her job termination, if she had applied these skills more aptly during her initial conversation with the CFO perhaps this story has a different outcome.

> The skills of emotional intelligence do not guarantee health, wealth, or happiness.  The rewards awaiting the emotionally intelligent manager may not be measurable in money, power, or prestige but in the desire and the ability to do well for oneself and for others.
